kv7w9p,None,N/A,futuristic smart glass company dd view inc 🚀🚀🚀 black mirror potential,DD,5,1,Aggressivestonk,4,the ticker is cfii merging with view inc a sleeping giant for close to months many people do not realise this company is riding on the green energy wave which has rallied significantly over the past weeks now heres a deep dive into this company detailed dd but if you are lazy to read the research i dont blame you just head to the potential plays at the bottom since merger was announced on nov and now that we are in q of and approaching the merger date in roughly months time the share price has been steadily advancing i think that the current share price of $ still presents a rather good riskreturn profile in the short term to enter mainly riding on the green energy wave i have presented plays for this at the bottom of this dd most have downplayed this company due to its high valuation of $b for just being a window company nonev especially in a period where commercial real estate is taking a hit due to the pandemic but i think precisely this is a good time to invest for the long term before the next boom we might also have overlooked certain secular trends in motion that can provide some serious tailwind for this company now taking a deep dive into the company the product gtview is the market leader in nextgeneration smart windows that use artificial intelligence and machine learning which will tint the glass to optimize natural light while controlling heat and glare effectively eliminating the need for blindsshades in the room the smart glass enhances mental and physical wellbeing for occupants creating smart connected buildings which reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions basically they are the nextera windows maker for smart buildings think of your standard runofthemill window glass panes if you live in a tropical climate or countries with high sunlight hours you would know that having a window seat in the noon is extremely uncomfortable and glaring even if the the blindsshades were drawn down the airconditioning will still have to work extra hard to maintain the same room temp by doing so the buildings energy consumption is higher higher green house emission aienabled window glass tinting tracking suns trajectory what if you had a smart dynamic glass installed which will automatically tint the windows by tracking the suns trajectory aside from the glare protection from the tinting the temperature in the room is also effectively maintained by blocking out solar heat so the hvac does not have to work overtime what if this glass panel can also act as a transparent hd display for a suite of immersive work experiences the building window glass market is huge having a $ billion tam in north america alone and $ trillion tam in global glass consumption smart buildings are perhaps the key to the future of urban planning due to the push for green innovation in smart cities that has gained momentum and will continue to do so under bidens administration esggreen wave biden administration clean energy plan to tackle climate change resulted in the rally of greenenergy stocks recently tailwind can be expected from the green wave for view inc since their dynamic glass will help buildings attain leed certification to become more energy efficient with the growing requirements from regulators in us and rising importance of esg globally view inc can help buildings reduce overall energy consumption and green house emission through reduction in hvac amp lighting consumption with overall peak energy reduction analysis of product suite of services they are not just a smart windows maker but essentially a tech play as well they have launched their suite of services in to complement the smart glass comprising view net provides bandwidth power and data network that is the backbone to an intelligent building platform view immersive experience transparent seethrough hd display on the window that is fully interactive with touchscreen capabilities view sense modules that provide the ability to measure and optimise light humidity temperature air quality that cater to the wellbeing of occupants inside the building transparent hd display with g network what i like about the product is that its very modular and customisable for the basic package you can just have the dynamic smart glass installed with just the tinting capabilities however the infrastructure for other capabilities is already installed after the initial set up which customers can choose to add on different modules eg sensorsdisplays and customise it based on their needs this effectively sets up for repeat businesses longevity you may be wondering about the longevity of their smart windows since functionality will never be given due consideration if the product is shitty and fails to withstand the weathertimepressure if the smart windows are treated like consumables with the need to replacemaintain every few years it will never be scalable you may hear it from the ceo himself on how their team initially conceptualise the product and build it around a fundamental principle in mind longevity therefore the lifespan is similar to standard window glass with over years of lifespan video watch from onwards durability another point about why view inc glass is more durable than than other dynamic smart windows is because they are using an inorganic ceramic material as the nanocoating layer instead of organic material which is the current industry norm even though organic material is cheaper to engineer resulting in a cheaper product for their end clients but the coating will be degraded by the heat from the sun which will make it less durable over time market share currently they are leading the market with over market share in terms of economic moat they have over k patents currently filed this is a proprietary tech and after years of rampd i think that they will be able to fairly sustain a huge competitive advantage over many other competitors and effectively creating a high barrier to entry for new entrants due to the sheer amount of patents they possess pricing amp revenue current revenue as of stands at around $m with over $m in backlog orders loi signed although their dynamic window glasses cost upward of more than standard window glasses i think its a highly differentiated product in which building owners can eventually charge a premium on rental leases resulting in higher leasing revenues for them one success case story is civica cherry creek an office building in denver has managed to achieve the highest weighted average rental rates out of any office buildings in denver city after switching to views glass of course i anticipate a huge inertia in the beginning where the mass market will put up resistance to adopt this product however overtime combining the economies of scale in their factories to bring down production costs higher gross margins and rising demand globally arising from a proven track record i can foresee exponential growth for this company in the long term they are expecting revenue growths to be around cagr over the next years which i personally think its possible but the exponential growth will not happen till onwards since they need the initial two years for market entry into more marketssectors investors early prominent vc funding include corning and softbank however i wish to point out that in recent sec filings gic investment singapore stateowned sovereign fund owned by the government of singapore initiated a stake of $ million in cfii last week and an additional $ million pipe investment today let me tell you why im so bullish about this singapore is a highly developed and urbanised country located in southeast asia with a myriad of highrise buildingsskyscrapers tropical climate with plenty of sun activity all year round although na market is huge but usually buildings in states with most sunlight activity eg californiaarizona will constitute the main bulk of customers lets imagine if the product is able to break into the asia market or even into southeast asia with tropical climate zones the revenues would be insane gic obviously conducted their dd as they wont screw around with stateowned money they know the growth potential of this proprietary tech once this hits the market big time and perhaps even a business arrangement to bring this product into singapore other players will likely not stand a chance with the exception of china ability to scale current projects are only in the commercial space which has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic with the ongoing trend in wfh the residential market is essentially a cash cow for milking especially against the backdrop of demand for healthy home working environment in light of this the ceo said in an interview that he has already completed residential projectsthis wasnt published as its still in the works and he is developing a product for residential market this year to target contemporary homes link from onwards the convergence of wfh trend and smart homes will definitely be a huge play even more so than commercial does it reminds you of netflixs black mirror transparent displays are certainly a sight to behold touchscreen capabilities given the ubiquitous applications with glass possibilities are not limited to just smart buildings in fact one really strong partnership with great potential would be to license the proprietary tech to ev car makers incredible synergy can be found in the future of electric vehicle glass display where car window panels can function as a smart display with vehicle integration auto tinting capabilities in fact the entire transportation industry could be disrupted by this tech think of your busesrailssubwaycruises and how smart glass display could reinvent the future of advertisements in commercial transportation and how fast would they jump on this bandwagon if they are able to monetise this new piece of glass other uses across different sectors include the hospitality industry airports hotels resorts and healthcare sector like hospital wards windows fyi they have piloted their product in different us airports namely sfo dallasfort worth and boston airports after retrofitting their smart glass in the airports results were rather stellar with an actual increase in concessionary sales energy cost savings as well as longer dwell time in such areas case study for dfo airport bear casedownsides glassdoor rating of company seems poor with management woes at the executive level and there were reports of view inc laying off their staff sometime in april i think that internal turmoil would be detrimental and could impede their growth in the future current earnings of $m in does not really justify the valuation of $b much speculation is on future growth potential they have a current minimum order of $m which will not sit well with smaller commercial buildings or residential market this will result in them losing market share gradually to their smaller competitors who can cater to such clientele the biggest risk to their intellectual property is that it is not universal ie it does not have an international protection patents are territory rights so even though their tech is protected in us i expect proliferation of copy cats in other countries like coughs china they may register for ip in china as well but lets face it its not exactly foolproof and chinese companies operate differently in china although there will be imitations but i believe that views level of rampd is extremely strong after years in operation other copycat smart glass companies would unlikely be able to achieve the same level of product as view thus ensuring levels of product differentiation the play with the merger expected to complete by q of months time i expect cfii to pop closer to merger date during march perhaps in the $$ range but once it reaches ath right before merger it will probably be a good time to sell as once postmerger happens and downside cap is removed it will most likely fall below $ or even lower as the industry is very capex intensive in addition i think that the commercial space is likely to remain sluggish in the near term which will push the price further down it will also likely burn more cash in the process since you have to bear in mind that any new futuristic tech adoption is an extremely long and arduous process revolutionary tech like iphonestesla did not pick up from the getgo after it was introduced to the market and it took several years before they saw some real results this is probably a good time to accumulate your positions while its being massively hated on and believe in the conviction that they are the market leader with a wide economic moat gtk patents and ability to scale up while bringing down costs secular esg trend with bidens green plan will provide good tailwind for the sector at least for the next years in which their policies will likely benefit the industry multiple uses applications are huge with amazing potential for licensingpartnership plays in evhospitalityhealthcare sectors i have strong conviction in the long term that it is going to be a multibagger if you keep accumulating the dips postmerger tldr in short buy now for the premerger pop and sell right before merger following a postmerger selloff accumulate on the dip and ride on for the long term in the next few years positions warrants $ link to investor

mt schnitzer steel industries inc schn posco pkx and olympic steel inc zeus link the steel industry has kicked off the new year on a high note building on the strong recovery that started in the final quarter of shares of major steel companies are heading higher this month the momentum has been driven by surging steel prices on the back of rising steel demand amid supply shortage and prospects of infrastructure stimulus package this year from the biden administration material stocks got a thrust after the us congress formally certified joe biden as the next president last thursday biden has proposed spending $ trillion over four years to boost clean energy and rebuild infrastructure the planned investment includes building and repairing roads bridges water systems electricity grids and broadband aimed at fixing americas crumbling infrastructure american steel stocks have been gaining this month on hopes that the sizable infrastructure spending would have a beneficial effect on the us steel industry given the expected increase in consumption of the commodity that is used to make almost everything from rail tracks to roads to bridges and tunnels notably shares of major us steel makers such as united states steel corp are up this month the optimism can also be gauged from the fact that the zacks steel producers industry has gained so far this month outperforming the sampp indexs appreciation the steel industry has been urging for an infrastructure package since the early days of the pandemic leading us steel industry groups in march had called on congress to include significant infrastructure investment in the next stimulus package to help the nation recover from the fallout of the deadly virus outbreak the pandemicinduced demand destruction put a crimp on the steel industry for much of the first half of however an upturn in demand from the key industries such as automotive and construction and an upswing in steel prices have pulled the industry out of its funk automotive and construction together account for a big chunk of steel consumption recovery started to gain steam toward the end of the third quarter of on resumption of operations across major steelconsuming sectors following easing of lockdowns and restrictions across the world steel prices are also shooting higher on an upturn in demand steel stocks also started to rebound in the second half of after getting hammered during the first half along with most other commodities amid the pandemicled demand slowdown steel makers are seeing strong order booking in automotive recovery in the automotive industry has accelerated following pandemicled shutdowns on the back of strong customer demand the automotive rebound is driving demand for flat steel products globally moreover the revival in the construction sector globally is driving demand for long and flat steel products in this major market the construction sector has also bounced back on the heels of a resumption of projects that were stalled earlier due to supply chain disruptions and manpower shortage in particular the nonresidential construction market remains resilient meanwhile a strong recovery in construction and manufacturing activities is driving demand for steel in china the worlds top consumer of the commodity steel demand is being driven by the chinese governments spending on infrastructure projects a rebound in chinas demand has instilled optimism in the steel space moreover steel prices are on an upswing on the back of rising demand supply shortages and higher raw material costs notably us steel prices have staged a strong recovery and hit record levels after cratering to pandemicinduced multiyear lows in august the benchmark hotrolled coil “hrc” prices started to recover in september and are screaming higher since then prices zoomed past $ per short ton in december on us steel mills price hike actions tight supply and rising demand and are hovering near the $ per short ton level last attained in in fact hrc prices have catapulted to levels not seen in more than years and doubled the lows witnessed in august a key reason behind the spurt in steel prices is the demandsupply imbalance lead times for steel delivery at us steel mills remain extended indicating healthier demand moreover supply remains restricted due to the idling of blast furnaces and production disruptions associated with mill outages these coupled with lower steel imports due to the pandemic and tariffs have resulted in the tightening of steel supplies a situation which is likely to sustain over the short haul steel scrap prices are also on the rise amid tight supply as such there is room for further upside in hrc prices as the fundamentals driving factors remain in place higher demand elevated input costs and supply constraints are likely to continue lending support to hrc prices over the near term higher prices would drive profitability and cash flows of steel companies redhot steel stocks

kx6s1x,None,N/A,serious dd gopro is about to be the next turnaround story and short squeeze,DD,5,0.73,ChinaTrumper,35,gopro has had some recent momentum but its about to be the bigger turnaround story of some people were asking why and so im sharing my compelling case why they will not only crush their upcoming q earnings but also establish a record turnaround with consecutive quarter profitability hype and 🌈🐻 getting short squeezed no excessive rocket emojis no edgy lingo trying to be one of the gang just some solid dd summary revenue for q exploded to $ million qoq from $ million in q with record ecommerce industry sales in and q gopros already successful directtoconsumer pivot and new subscription income channel i expect them to hit new q revenue and profit records exceeding their $ million recorded from q oh and add a short squeeze on top subscribers to their paid subscription program passed k up qoq and yoy based on growth rate its likely theyll hit million before end of q i explain below why there is so much momentum and goodness that will come from this they were profitable in q and crushed expectations beating nongaap eps of $ beats by $ and gaap eps of $ beats by $ gaap gross margin for q was up from yearoveryear nongaap gross margin for q was up from yearoveryear not only were they profitable but they reduced nongaap operating expenses by $m yoy and reduced a whopping yearoveryear we should expect to see more efficiencies in q gpro is flush with $ million in cash and investments thats up to yoy and now theyre likely about to post recordbreaking profitable q earnings heres why q monster earnings is likely successful directtoconsumer pivot has been a record year for all ecommerce and gopro has already shown a successful pivot from big box retailers to growing their own directtoconsumer online programs saving margin by selling directly from their own website without needing to pay commission gopros direct business has grown more profitable in recent years with millions of unique visitors each month and in it was already generating more than of revenue in top european markets and nearly in the united states the covid pivot of has likely pumped those rookie numbers up q will confirm a profitable trend gopro hasnt had two consecutive profitable quarters in five years typically it reaches profitability with a new camera launch last year the company launched their h camera in the fourth quarter this year it launched the h camera in the third quarter and we know they saw record black friday and cyber monday sales i am amped that q results will confirm the turnaround trend covid vaccine amp seasonal goodness – covid has been a blessing in disguise for gopro due to lockdowns pushing people outdoors the perfect use case for their action camera segment in we will continue to see more goodness for reasons as vaccine rollout expands instore retail purchases will likely climb reviving a major revenue channel coming springoutdoors season will likely increase more sales driven by pent up demand for postlockdown travel you can buy like cameras with buydens k stimis consumer brand to tech company profitable cloud storage subscription service last quarter was a record quarter for gopros subscription program essentially a cloud storage service if you didnt know in gopro launched a new subscription service for $month that includes unlimited video storage in the cloud discounts on accessories and a device warranty its since turned into fast growing revenue and profit channel regardless of where consumers purchase gopro now owns the postpurchase customer relationship with its subscribers and is driving repeat purchases and revenue through memberonly discount programs and monthly storage fees increasing the lifetime value of every purchasing customer the subscription program has only accelerated pushing past subscribers from record black friday and cyber monday sales meaning more customers than ever that are providing greater returns than ever based on growth rates i have a hunch theyll announce a new subscription milestone between k or past m by feb earnings announce and start seeing real bottom line impact from their cloud storage service short squeeze likely the current short interest ratio is near historic highs at and while not gme level high there are m shorted shares at a volume of $m the highest in at least years the increased buy volume ahead of expected earnings what i expect will be a downright righteous q beat will be a catalyst to push the price as bears buy back to cut their losses target and positions earnings is likely and i can see it confidently reaching or as high as from a milestone q beat and turnaround i think positive momentum could push it as high as by may if they can pull a profitable trifecta personally i have mostly shares plus some c and c amp c which seem to have the best available volume and open interest though like gme shares are my long term play there are probably some good counter arguments why im retarded but gopro makes solid products record profits and is evolving into a true tech company with its cloud service amp gopro

kxdyg8,None,N/A,smartsheet nyse smar deep dive research,DD,10,0.92,Historical-Comment36,27,tldr this is part of what is now going to be a three part deep dive on smartsheet ticker smar this second part walks you through the beginning of my four piece framework of trying to figure out if the stock can x from here leadership risks price and growth in this second part we are just going to focus on leadership as i was writing i found that leadership is a very important part of the smartsheet story and it needed its own article to do it justice you can read part here smartsheet is an exciting saas company thats helping businesses be more productive and get the most out of their people i am not a financial advisor and this is not investment advice these are just my opinions to help facilitate learning and discussion hi everyone thanks for coming back for part im excited to bring you more research and insights on smartsheet nyse smar lets dive in can we x from here for someone like me that is on the younger side and with a longer investment time horizon and probably you if you are reading this an important question to ask yourself is “do i think this investment could x from here” in other words could this investment one day be times what it is worth today to try to answer this question i will work through a predetermined framework that i believe gives us the best path to find out the framework includes leadership – desire purpose and ownership risk considerations price considerations explosive business growth leadership – desire purpose ownership for a company to do something as spectacular as x we are going to need to see really strong and talented leadership in chris mayers excellent book “ baggers” he dedicates a part of the book to talk about the importance of what he calls “owner operators” by this he means that the ceo of the company owns a substantial amount of stock in the company themselves why is this important if the ceo has their own personal wealth at stake in the companys stock just like we do as shareholders their interests are more aligned with shareholders and maximizing returns for shareholders than they would be if that ceo had no skin in the game its also better in my opinion if the ceo of the company was also the founder of the company for these founderceos that have money invested in their own company it really is like their baby would you rather have your money invested with someone who views the company as their baby or with someone who was just hired to watch this kid the company in the case of smartsheet we check all the boxes when it comes to leadership mark mader is not only an owner operator he is also a cofounder i touched on this a little bit in part but mark cofounded smartsheet along with brent frei in they both played football american football for dartmouth college an ivy league school they met in the fall of when mark was a freshman on the team and brent who had graduated the prior year was serving as a graduate assistant for the team after that season brent moved on to begin a career in computer engineering mark quit the football team after year in an interview with forbes he said that after his freshman season he thought it was too much to juggle ivy league academics and being a ncaa division athlete mark started focusing solely on academics until a tragedy struck one of his best friends from his high school football team got into an accident and was critically injured his friend would never be able to play football again this had a profound impact on mark he said in the interview that knowing one of his friends would never be able to play again made him realize that if he still has the ability to play football he needs to go do it he went to his old coach told him the story about his friend and asked for his spot on the team back the coach accepted and mark went on to finish his career in the fall of as a ” lb offensive lineman mark said that this experience with his friend and rejoining the football team taught him not to take anything for granted he said ever since then he tries to do his best with everything and make the most out of every opportunity that mindset has served him well as he now sits as a ceo of a $ billion company but hes really just getting started that mindset lives on today the day that he took smartsheet public april he was asked if he plans on celebrating the achievement he said “we have customers that dont want us to party they want us to work on the product” how did mark get to the point where he was ceo of a tech company with customers that raised $ million during their ipo ill share with you a little more history behind the company after brent frei left dartmouth he started his career in computer engineering as i mentioned before his career started with motorola in then he went to microsoft in and then he founded his first company onyx software in it didnt take long before his buddy from college mark mader would come join him at the startup mark joined in and eventually worked his way up to an executive role within the firm the focus of onyx was customer relationship management crm software brent was the ceo and mark became the svp of global services brent led the company through an ipo in right before the tech bubble burst it was really unfortunate timing because a lot of their customers were dotcoms that went out of business brent was still able to lead them through stiff competition with salesforce in the early s until he hit a plateau in he decided to step down from the company he had founded years earlier on his last call with investors he was quoted as saying “i believe its the right time for me to turn over the reins to a new ceo who can take onyx to new heights over the next decade” all the while mark was there in the background learning and observing he saw what went right – they built a large publicly traded company from scratch and he saw what went wrong – their growth stalled as they lost market share to salesforce only a year after resigning from onyx brent was on to his next big move and he again recruited his friend mark to help they were going to found smartsheet a company to help improve the way people work this time mark was a cofounder along with brent and had a much bigger influence on the company his influence got even larger in years after the founding when brent left to found his rd company terraclear brent left to go back to his roots in idaho where he grew up on the family farm his new startup terraclear seeks to solve one of the largest unsolved problems in farming today – clearing rocks from farming land as crazy as that sounds apparently its a big issue hence the name terraclear brent is still on the board of directors of smartsheet going back to the ipo date april which was only months after brent had left mark was asked by the press what he had learned from being at onyx when they went public mark was very clear in his response and said that one of the main lessons from onyx was to “not get too enamored with your product” with smartsheet he wants to make sure theyre always improving the product and the user experience he also said that investors dont buy a stock based on what youve done in the past but what you plan to do “if you are always looking at the rear view mirror then you are not running the business” he said this is exactly how i want the leaders of companies i invest in to be thinking he is very forward thinking customer focused and humble there is a lot of evidence to corroborate that he has followed through on the statements he made that day one of the first pieces of evidence i found that supports my thesis of mark being very focused on the product and user experience is the incredible ratings that the product has received from its customers i use a tool called net promoter score nps which is one of the most reliable and unbiased ways to find out what a customers true experience with a business is and how likely they would be to recommend it to a friend for smartsheet their nps is extremely high its on a scale of to so anything above is considered to be good if the rating is above it essentially more people would recommend the product to a friend than they would tell them not to use it smartsheet has an nps of which is honestly one of the highest i have ever seen further evidence to support mark and the rest of managements commitment to product quality and user experience is the exceptional ratings the product has on the apple app store this is just for the mobile version of the product the app that you can download on your phone just like you would download the mobile version of outlook the rating in the app store is thats very impressive as well based on how customers are responding to the product i think its fair to say that mark was not bsing his way through that interview on ipo day he and his management team really have been focused on creating a stellar product and the results are showing when i say that “desire and purpose” are important traits of a leader of a company it means that i want to see a leader who has a real desire to do what heshe is doing as the ceo of the company believes in their products and services and has a real purpose for why they want to do that i can tell that mark is committed to the mission of improving the way people work being one of the founders and having written an ebook on the “productivity paradox” that i mentioned in part i think this mission is very near and dear to his heart and that he has a desire to see the impact and scale of his company grow well into the future as shareholders thats what we want another way to see if the leader of the company has “desire and purpose” is to see how hisher employees perceive them do the employees look up to this person do they feel motivated to work hard because they know what theyre doing is meaningful and can make a positive difference in peoples lives one way i have of gaining insight into this is to look at the companys glassdoor ratings and specifically the rating of the ceo in the case of smartsheet the positive story continues the company has a rating on glassdoor and mark has a approval rate from his employees which is well above average to me this shows hes communicating the companys purpose to the employees very well and is motivating them to actualize that purpose theres one other piece of evidence i stumbled upon that gives good insight into the culture that mark and his management team are building at smartsheet they were recently awarded “best company culture” and “best companies for women” by comparably below you can see a screenshot of the headline from a business wire article about this its one thing to be awarded for “best company culture” but to also be a “best companies for women” when youre in a heavily male dominated industry such as computer software that really says something it speaks to the culture of diversity and inclusiveness that mark is building there which goes a long way in the year when social issues are at the forefront of peoples minds more than ever the modern enterprise has to build a culture of diversity and inclusiveness if they want to retain the most talented employees and keep them motivated smartsheet is doing a good job of this source – smartsheet making headlines for their outstanding company culture i think weve found a lot of evidence to support that this leadership team has a strong desire to fulfil their purpose its evident that they want to help improve the way people work and that theyve invested heavily into making this happen while keeping employees motivated and focused on the goal the last piece i look at for leadership is ownership does the ceo have a personal financial stake in the company this is such a key thing to look for because as i mentioned earlier in the article if leadership themselves owns a substantial amount of shares then their interests and motivations will align with us the shareholders they essentially are a shareholder too just like us on top of the desire and purpose that weve established is present theres also a financial incentive for mark and the team to lead the company to success and ultimately a higher share price currently mark holds shares which comes out to a value of $ million as of this writing id consider that substantial for an individual person even more noteworthy is that brent owns million shares which comes out to a value of $ million brent owns that much of the company still and hes not even involved beyond being on the board of directors i think thats a testament to how much confidence he has in mark to lead smartsheet to new heights also its important to keep in mind that he left smartsheet to help with his family business he saw his year old dad picking up rocks on the farm with his bare hands and realized he wanted to help solve this problem in the farming industry leaving smartsheet was not like when he left onyx because the business was plateauing as a matter of fact smartsheet was rapidly growing at that time and was about to go public the fact that he still has $ million worth of shares in the company shows he still believes in the company and what mark can do with it now and in the future this concludes part of my smartsheet deep dive

ky9m34,None,N/A,unusual options activity whale watching tips,DD,12,1,AllDatDalton,256,this is long if youre uninterested skip to the ten tips list or tldr a while ago i started mixing unusual options activity into my gambling at first i lost a shitload of money chasing dumbass whales with zero plan but now i actually have a pretty good feel for it i still fuck up alot but more often i do not fuck up this is to help those of you who want to start chasing whales or are at a basic level and want to do it better im using some plays from this week as examples because they are fresh in my mind and i have a couple screenshots tools i use barchart you can honestly get by using their free version you just cant sort as well they have a free month trial too i also pay the bucks for unusual whales to confirm what i scan i have zero affiliation to either just saying what i use there are way more technical ways to do this but i like to use my eyes to scan sporadically throughout the day like a boomer basic concept long story short youre ideally chasing the options purchases of what are presumably deeppocketed individuals or institutions uoa identifies certain options contract orders that are higher than the average daily contract order for example if the average daily option volume on an gme weekly is and an option order enters for or higher its flagged as unusual activity since its a multiple of that daily average volumesometimes it shows as multiple orders if they push through a few smaller purchases that produce heavy volume mm are sneks who like to move in silence which they can do with with stock positions via dark pools and shit however they cant get away with that with options activityit all shows that fact young autist is your slingshot against the institutional goliath hunting the whale so ive got my unusual options activity page open on barchart or wherever for the current day i adjust the expiration date option so that the options im looking at dont expire past a couple weeks out more on why earlier then im ready to eye scan i typically start by looking for one of two things large clusters of orders that belong to one ticker or sporadic orders for a ticker that consistently show up over a couple hours but belong to nonhot nonmeme stonk that does not have earnings imminents to make sure im looking at something potentially weird i choose to exclude options that expire more than a couple weeks out clusters of orders—abnb example the way i scope it is kind of a tiered process first im looking to see if there are any clusters of orders that catch my eye on a quick scan second im looking to see if those clusters of orders contain both calls and puts with some otm activity and spreads preferred third i look to see if the number of call seperate call orders outweighs the number of put orders or vice versa and additionally i look to see if the volume of the calls drastically outweighs the volume of the puts or vice versa why because it helps you determine if the options order is just a hedge or if its hedging against itself as its own position this is super important so try to follow along most uoa is just institutions hedging mr mm has a nice busy life and fancy yacht and cant just exit his positions back and forth all day like a wsber he also has like a billion shares of his stonks so if he dumps it when hes got paper hands it will siginficantly tank the value and cause a ripple effect so instead of hedging by dumping his shit he hedges by adding otm options against his positionnext level fucking diamond hands that would be the type of whale order from mr mm we dont want to follow but if mr mm buys fb call options in a few blocks and you see like in fb puts go through right alongside it the odds are that someone is betting big on fb and using the puts as a hedge since its a smaller volume instead of the options being a hedge for a bigger bet in their stocks the those type of option clusters indicate the option order is the big play and its hedging itself then i do an easy confirmation i check their general trend the past week or so in a chart do a news search on twitter with their ticker for news catalysts and sentiment and google and youtube to see if the crayola kids think its a good nerd play example heres the screenshot on some abnb uoa i noticed and played this week it went to and change within a couple hours but i had unortunate diamond hands and sold for about half that abnb uoa so this a softball first you can see that abnb all of a sudden explodes with all those options showing up at thats our cluster second the clusters have both calls and puts in that minute with some put orders at the bottom some of the calls are deep otm as far as c third the call orders far outweigh the put orders in both amount and volume awwwww shit looks like we got more than a hedgewere onto something confirmation time abnb had been on a general uptrend and i typically dont like to chase but i combed twitter and saw their were rumors of the ceo speaking the following day and that news had just broken of their dc booking cancellations i looked back into the morning and saw a few more unusual blocks and a few more rolled in just after that one passed the smell test options bought tendies gained sparse orders snap example the same principles can apply to orders on tickers that pop up individual orders not large clusters which a havent had much attention b have been on a steep downtrend—this makes the order unusual andor c seem to keep popping up in single orders over a few hours to a daythe same principles as above apply but if you see these types of orders with very little time left until expiration you can assume assume its probably not a hedge snap isnt the best example of the week because there wasnt a put order in this block but there was positive ta sentiment when i searched snap had been on an oversold downtrend and i dont have screenshots left of the better ones i saw and went after plus importantly it was towards the end of the day this is huge eod is prime time for ah news whales snap uoa a better example from this week though is spce which had only a few orders sprinkled throughout the day and a one toward the end of the day which was deep deep otm expiring thats a flag for us—sporadic listing throughout the day otm toward the end of the day bam eod otm calls sprinkle in ark invests sparse orders patterns connecting the dots on tech rebound with fb and snap seeing the snap orders above sharpened my eyes to looking for a pattern with tech on the whole since big tech had been so royally gaped the past week i kept seeing fb options like this pop up sometimes you can put together sporadic listings and create a working theory based on a sector because this and similar fb orders were deep otm and one day out i knew there was a risk they could a hedge but also knew that the tech sector was due for a rebound and saw snap posting sporadic otm as well so i bought my options for each of those two another week out and closer to atm important more below to give the whale some breathing room in case was it was a hedge even though the technicals agreed with the bounce the whales were right and it was an easy little overnight profit how ive fucked up dont get tricked by trends although we like to believe institutions are ahead of the curve often they are just dickriding lemmings who follow whats already way way up they buy the top just like wsb tardies such as yourself specialize in when you see shit like this think before you get excited nio uoa like this was nonstop it was the same for all the memes plug fcel mara and riot all week dominating the orders if something is already too popular just stay away from it you can ride something up but when you see massive orders on shit thats already like iv justdont how ive fucked up do give the mms some breathing room even if youre confident in a move you see that is a few days out extend your play a week or two out and strike it closer to atm if you cant do either of those things because you cant afford it just skip that play and check back for something new later i promise better opportunity will arise you can recover from bagholding but you cannot recover from blowing your account on an incorrect dte breathing room is also important because often whales will have the news but not the exact timing two months ago i followed a ddog whale on a thursday dte that expired worthless the next day the following monday trade day later ddog made the announcement that rocketed them like if id given them a weeks breathing room it wouldve been a bagger fucking f so to review look for order clusters or sporadic ticker order that a have a mix of calls and puts with one dominating the other b unpopular tickers that have deep otm or close expirations c always check chatter afterward and fundamentals and d try to put together a narrative of things that are related that catch your eye this mondays ev run or this fridays tech bounce could be next weeks airline dominance or cruiseline crazeconnect the dots initially look for options expiring soon as they indicate the most riskinessand therefore confidenceif the mm is not hedging things that will help you not guh monday and friday morningafternoon are the most accurate whale times according to data from unusual whales if you dont have pdt always save some spending power for eod shopping if you dont have pdt never ever follow a whale with a weekly sometimes the news the whales bets on is a sell the news event always give the whale breathing room by purchasing an expiration at least a week further out b always give the whale breathing room by going closer to atm strikes than theirs sign up for barchart monthly trial and unusual whalestheyre each like bucks and thats way less than you spend on an fd you dont need to learn ta but you need to check technicals on the tickers you want to chasealmost every major ticker has youtubers or fintwits giving their daily or weekly ta this way you know if its a proper breakout happening if the whale hits and youre not just guessing at when to take profits remember they can buy wayyyyyyy otm and sell for massive profit at any pointthey arent bagholding until its in the money leave at least of your account spending power free each day i promise the one time you go full boat you will see the most obvious whale play at the end of the day then you wont be able to do shit about it and youll hate yourself when its a bagger overnight trust me make sure the ticker youre chasing isnt just er anticipationbets always check earnings dates before buying remember whales are people so they can be stupid too dont baghold a position that is clearly fucked for some news that looks unlikely to come they are gambling addicts just like you except they have more money always take profits if you ask yourself if its time to if its good enough to screenshot its good enough to close the position positions dumped a ton of stuff and loading up tuesday because long weekends scare me but saw some ineresting s i held including wkhsc pltrc spyc lmndp and a couple tickers that i couldnt post lol also have aapl and jd leaps tldr use a service to follow whales so you can get ahead of announcements look for clusters of options activity that hedge themselves via callput ratio and do a legitimate check for ta and catalysts to confirm their moves never follow a whale into a weekly but use weeklies are your best screener i might do a pretty consistent dd post a couple times a

ky4211,PLUG,-51.46%,plug and why the next three years are going to be humongous,DD,7,0.73,alltrex,64,alright shut the fuck up about gme for a second and im gonna make you money yall heard alot about plug from a few places as of late yes it has exploded in the last month alone but it isnt over right now the sentiment is bearish and i agree in the short term but long term plug is only going to keep growing there are a few key points i want to highlight plug is singlehighhandedly the largest hydrogenfuelcell titan in the industry years of industry under its belt it now services amazon with active forklifts and walmart uses roughly active vehicles now they are partnering with two more titans renault and sk group the french and south korean markets respectively first renault renault is well established in france and is backed by the government itself the deal with renault is huge for plug in the european market the two plan to establish an innovation center for development of fuel cell technology in lcv vehicles for future renault platforms initially heavy vans and utility they plan on combining manufacturing with renault establishing a vertically integrated fuel cell stack system and a manufacturing center in france expansion of refueling systems to accommodate the new market the deal will only accelerate in the future as renault plans to adopt plug power technology in commercial fleets why is renault interested well the eu announced a plan calling for europe to have at least six gigawatts of renewable hydrogen electrolyzers by a critical period for plug for a few more reasons and the production of up to million tonnes of renewable hydrogen doable sure but the bigger picture is this this is almost exactly how the rise of the solar industry happened eu plans into the future the european union unveiled a plan this month to invest hundreds of billions of euros in technologies enabling it to get a substantial share of its energy from hydrogen by this is potentially insane second group sk group is planning to invest billion usd in an intention to form a joint venture next year the goal is to provide south korea and later a possibility of the larger asian market hydrogen fuel cell systems particularly infrastructure and electrolyzers power stations basically there is however no information if plug is planning on directly partnering with any manufacturers in korea i will get to this later why is sk group interested in plug plans call to build a liquid hydrogen plant with an annual capacity of tons in incheon in to be scaled up to tons in the south korean governments commitment to shift the to hydrogen with million dollars this year a increase from last year now whats the point of all this infrastructure i understand the powerplants but is the future just going to be us driving in amazon forklifts says you a dumbass who doesnt do dd and leaves it up to others in what is basically a casino sweet summer child hydrogen fuel is going to be big in the automotive scene yes papa musk hates it so fucking what keep buying one year out calls otm and tell musk to fuck off with how much bank youre going to make gm may have made a statement that they are going for all hydrogen back in but they have since rescinded that statement their hydrogen plan still remains though fuelcell powertrains will be used in military and commercial vehicles honda is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology the honda clarity they plan on expanding on the line greatly as they seem to be extremely set on becoming green hyundai is already selling a vehicle with hydrogen fuel cell technology the hyundai nexo hyundai motor group and its suppliers plan to spend of trillion won us$ billion through to raise production of fuel cells by more than fold as the south korean automaker targets to become a key player in the newenergy vehicle technology so much money is flowing into hydrogen fuel cell technology why is noone capitalizing on it the play wait for volatility to die down plug has had a massive run up truly tremendous and im glad to have been in plug for a long while the hype is almost certainly blown up and general market attitude is that it is a sell which i agree with tldr plug is going to return from lowearth orbit to refuel my price target is by midfeb before plug does a hindenburg and

kyt46m,FUBO,-27.45%,$fubo dd connecting the dots this thing is going to be a monster,DD,6,1,heardme,125,pretty sure most of you know $fubo has been shorted like crazy since the news of their victory acquisition it shot up with the news and has since lost most of those gains im here to tell you why the shorts are wrong and why this is a massive opportunity for us first id like to address the issue of profitability it was founded in and being a young growing company and isnt profitable yet to put things into perspective even netflix which was founded in wasnt profitable until fubo has more competition today than netflix did back then but its still growing rapidly q results revenues were $ million a increase yearoveryear on a pro forma basis or excluding licensing revenue from the facebank ag business sold in july this growth was driven by continued subscriber expansion an increase in subscription average revenue per user arpu and growth of advertising sales subscription revenue increased yearoveryear to $ million advertising revenue increased yearoveryear to $ million paid subscribers at quarter end totaled an increase of yearoveryear average revenue per user arpu per month was $ up yearoveryear total content hours streamed by fubotv users paid and free trial in the quarter increased yearoveryear to million hours monthly active users maus watched hours per month on average in the quarter an increase of yearoveryear q preliminary results q total revenue is expected to be between $$ million a to increase yearoveryear prior guidance was $$ million paid subscribers at yearend are expected to exceed an increase of more than yearoveryear prior guidance was subscribers it smashed its previous guidance because sports and normality are returning also note that fubo was still growing rapidly during the pandemic despite the lack of sports which is its primary focus this is huge and it will continue to grow faster as sports start to return to normal fubo is estimated to announce earnings between jan and feb ampxb most of us know that fubo was opportunistically hit by short sellers kerrisdalerich greendfield as their lock up period expired this made the stock tank considerably from its high of $ the short argument is that integrated sports betting is a pipe dream and that its not profitable yet as mentioned earlier it took netflix a while to scale up and become profitable at the rate fubo is growing they are going to be profitable sooner than later this isnt even an argument to me as they scale up a few things will happen customer acquisition costs will become a lower and lower percentage of revenue since they license their content they need scale to turn those licensing costs to profit just like netflix did more customers mean they can charge more for advertising more on this later fubo very clearly addressed the issue of integrated sports betting with the acquisition of vigtory the bear thesis is weakening significantly almost nonexistent ampxb ampxb now on to the nba over the past few years sky media led investment rounds in fubotv along with fox for a stake this investment round was increased in late early with sky media holding board positions the former nba commissioner was also part of the last $ million round media has gone through some very big mampa shifts at the toplevel with comcast acquiring sky and disney acquiring st century fox however for fubotvs formative years the company was influenced by arguably the top sports betting company in the world – sky media from the uk the comcastowned sky media is still a backer for fubotv along with disney david stern the late former nba commissioner was involved in funding of fubo the current nba commissioner adam silver worked extremely closely with his mentor ive been a lifelong nba fan and i had doubts in adam silver but i think hes done a fantastic job with the nba why am i bringing up the nba check the date of this and check the date of the fubo vigtory announcement people are missing some key elements to the nba announcement this announcement was made literally the day after the fubo victory acquisition people are missing the link between the nba and fubo let alone the timing fact check me they were announced a day apart and fubo is the only company with plans of an integrated sports betting broadcast platform the nba wants to get into this because they know viewers watch games for longer with sports betting and fantasy leagues which is why i think they threw in draftkings ampxb ampxb now lets look into two key acquisitions vigtory fubo acquired them and put their cofounder in charge of integrated sports betting along with their licenses and tech balto this one is another thing bears are missing they claim this acquisition was to get into sports betting it wasnt this was for their fantasy sports platform which fubo is also planning on integrating ampxb fubo is going to be an absolute monster going forward it is trading at a discount thanks to shorts m shares short of float shorted this thing is primed for an epic squeeze and its valued at a discount right now since the vigtory acquisition new price targets came out ranging from $ to $ short term im confident this thing will pop soon it was hammered down after the vigtory announcement by shorts followed by a low volume selloff friday its trading at imo a massive discount right now long term this thing is shaping up to be a unique competitor in streamingsports betting ampxb tldr get in long one way or another commons leaps anything this thing is going to explode as we inch towards earnings expected late january to midfebruary we got massive revenue growth we have strong tailwinds with the return of sports we have the nba basically saying theyre in as long as fubo can execute,2021-01-16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyt46m/fubo_dd_connecting_the_dots_this_thing_is_going/,1610773200

l0v1wb,GME,346.08%,gme the power of imagination a fresh value perspective 🚀🚀,DD,40,0.95,FREDRS7,79,first of all well played to everyone today most of you not paper handed bitches that shitron play was literally the raid boss round if we can bring the price back up from that fall then the future is already foretold they cant possibly having anything stronger than the biggest shorting name in the business known for massive price manipulations using their research i will imagine they will try the same shit with unlimited shorts alongside their stream and biden inauguration tomorrow so hold the fucking line diamond hands and we shall we rewarded obligatory 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 i love deep fucking value in both sense of the words i have this year exploited a massive value gap in rps group in the uk buying in around p now p a cheeky in months gme position shares $ now i want dig dip below the surface of your little smoothbrains and tap into that imagination here i will take you through some examples and imagine the future gme lets be aunt cathie like how she imagines branch future outcomes based on existing states ie tesla has good full self driving software way ahead of competitors therefore it can be the first mover in the autonomous taxi network at the end of the day our only limit is lord cohens imagination i want you to consider the whole world of gaming pc console handheld peripherals and chairs board games vr experiences merch performance enhancement esports im sure there are others i havent thought of the name is gamestop its strong and well known and is well distributed in the hearts of cities and towns its time people stop thinking about its as just a place that will only sell discs like a record store as an ecommerce opportunity gme can be one stop store for all of these as far as i understand there is not one decent site that offers all of this under one roof i have an example in another industry later amazon do all this retard but who honestly enjoys shopping at amazon literally its only good for fast free delivery its full of shitty chinese knockoffs searching is awful doesnt have half the stuff you want full of fake reviews and jeff is a wanker and amazon treat their workers like shit there is a gap in the market for a allinone game store with fast free delivery that treats its customers like saints any physical stores should reflect this and be like nerd nirvana latest cool products meet ups board game events esports tourneys repairs community hub for nerds spreading the sweet brand of gme this year i have spent over k on gaming stuff headset new pc chair ps to come rip stock this was a fucking mission having to go all over the internet to find good value and the bits i wanted with all the items ending up arriving at different times new pc from like different places scan amazon ebay box headset from scan chair direct from secret lab monitor from fuck knows where would have been so much easier if i good buy it all from one place and get a bulk discount for buying so much shit all these products bring me on to esports which ties into the game industry story esports is literally being eaten up by venture capitalists and smart brands guess who sponsors esl yes fucking mercedes benz amp dhl not who you think would advertise growup lel to supposably greasy fat pale skinned skint young esport neckbeards what boomers dont seem to get is that “gamers” arent like this and that they are the incoming middle class who will create families whose children will be brought up with brands their parents are exposed to they have well paid jobs like software engineers doctors teachers engineers this is literally wsb and is why boomers arent getting us and gme i mean look at our god dfv hes quirky but a normal guy and plenty of cash both of these companies have not only got pr gold as infamous memes we did it reddit mercedes embraced the meme dota have spread and dhl chants in stadiums have been sung but are gaining love for sponsoring events people are really passionate about gamers love things that support their passion and are very brand loyal and are the right age to sow deep brand loyalty now imagine gme starts getting involved in these events sowing its brand in the same way as mercedes to the same people that will then guaranteed buy stuff at its store its literally unbelievable this synergy hasnt been exploited yet i would love to see someone address all this stuff that actually knows advertising and marketing well compared to me just reading things over the years next i want to give you an example of some all in one stores that already outcompete amazon in a certain similar industry for this i will use bicycles yes you did hear me right as some of you will no doubt know the world of bicycles has so much symmetry with gaming bicycles owners love having the latest tech and coolest toys they love upgrading and are super passionate and proud about their hobby and are within an ecosystem both tech wise and like esports eg copying the gear of pro cyclists like esports watchers do of pro gamers watching big youtube channels with further advertised products – this is all gamers in a nutshell again i use myself as an example i use a sennheiser headset steelseries peripherals funnily i have bought these subconsciously via the sponsored products used by the team eg amazon and other mega stores whilst selling some stuff just dont compete with the specialised all in one ecommerce stores like wigglechain reaction cycles amp sigma sports of the bike stuff i have ever bought is from these they sell everything to do with bikes clothing merch health and nutrition components upgrades the list goes on sound familiar the products and ecosystem are just too technical and complex for some mega store like amazon to do it properly likewise amazon cannot focus on customer experience like these stores can which is important for technical products if there is a tech issue or a breakdown amazon is too big and spread out for its own good if you mention wiggle to someone” oh yeah thats the place that sends out haribo with every order” basically gme needs to integrate itself amongst the wider gaming world and community with strategic partnerships marketing and combine this with excellent customer service im sure big daddy cohen as already cottoned on to this lastly i want to bring your attention to games workshop in the uk its worth checking this out as to how gme may improve itself its literally the darling of the london stock exchange “the company is the best performing ftse retailer of the past decade” more importantly it shows how well a business with significant strategic brick and mortar and ecommerce presence can perform we should note lastly that although we dont have any proof any of this will occur sometimes you have to believe in the vision laid out by a man to extract ultimate value out of of a play cohen is our elon in this play hopefully this has opened your imagination to some extra pathways in the gme value thesis yours sincerely a tea drinker and fucking hold your shares like we held the line together in d

l0opur,THE,N/A,the next tesla and the industry leader in elon musks projected hot sector,DD,11,0.87,threefourpizza,62,dd on $stpk stem inc $stpk is an energy storage company focusing on battery storage systems network integration and battery optimization they brand themselves as the first pure play smart energy storage company to go public a lot of buzz words i know but bear with me first lets take a moment to quickly understand how battery storage works battery storage is a type of energy storage power station that uses a group of batteries to store electrical energy this is primarily used in the renewables space with solar and wind energy in recent years battery storage and in part renewable energy hasnt seen the exponential growth that many are expecting due to limitations in battery technology and high development costs this being said recent developments of battery tech and reduction of costs have now made battery storage much more feasible at the commercial industrial level battery storage still has ways to go in the residential space due to risks that come with it while battery storage has improved it will not be stand alone solution for many years to come because it simply isnt feasible with our global energy infrastructure battery storage will work with our interconnected grid to reduce imbalances between energy demand and energy production ok so now that we know how it works what does the market look like all major global markets are forecasted to double over the next decade over the next decade the us market is expected to grow at cagr and the global market is expected to grow cagr future tailwinds with improvements in the regulatory environment great so how is $stpk revolutionizing this space they are doing so by providing a one stop shop solution for utility companies stems solution can provide integrations with hardware batteries and the grid network while also using an ai powered software solution to optimize their energy storage their solution could possible replace other pure play companies in the value chain which is key interesting so lets move on to their ai software called athena athena is an operating system for energy distribution and storage systems collecting big data that enables customers to alternate between onsite generation grid power or battery power athena is a huge part of their value proposition and truly could be revolutionary it is a large part of their moat as they have issued patents for it so no competitor can replicate it now lets move onto their financials first its important to understand they have a hardware and software business increased rev from $ mil to $ mil yoy expected to increase to $ mil in cagr from gross margins have hovered around since but expected to increase to by of forecasted revs are from closed executed contracts not pipeline gt underpromising and overdelivering software revenue expected to account for of total revenues by $ mil in gt $ mil by a majority of their revenues are from their hardware segment but it will be interesting to see how athena contributes to their financials moving forward they need to execute yes but im confident they can do so given it has been in development for years and they have continuously improved upon due to years of data collection they might have used this time to validate athena with their customers and now feel comfortable scaling it exponentially lastly i was curious to see how they compare to tesla as well all know a large part of teslas valuation is their energy business interestingly enough they actually use batteries from tesla samsung and panasonic additionally they have a partnership with tesla in my opinion this is an extremely attractive play in the renewables space as it is one of the pick and shovel plays in the space if any of you are interested my investment thesis is finding the best pick and shovel plays in emerging industries such as renewable energy sports betting gambling genomics etc you can follow me on twitter for other dds i have done tldr stem is a leading player in the energy storage market as they have solutions to address all major aspects of the value chain more specifically large tam strong macro tailwinds $ trillion in new revenue opportunities for integrated storage expected to be deployed by battery storage capacity expected to increase by x by market leader with best in class technology systems operating or contracted with athena market share in ca btm storage market largest in the us first mover ai platform that operates with utilities grid operators and over mm runtime hours highly visible growth recurring revenue streams provide strong financial position to accelerate growth revenues projected to grow at cagr from to hope yall enjoy long $stpk edit just released new dd on precision biosciences $dtil could it be the next $bngo find out here now for the fucking walk street bets part of it elon musk said the most important things are ev solar energy and energy storage watch vid above at elon musk is building the batteries to store renewable energy $stpk uses there software on teslas batteriesand other batteries that makes them smart batteries $stpk has more sales then teslaany other competitor leading the market by using third party batteries from tesla so to have more sales it must mean there software is pretty damn good

l0ssqv,None,N/A,the reasons i think citron will present tmrw why theyre halftruths and what they will try to do after,Discussion,65,0.98,Fair_Chart3403,240,obligatory disclaimer i am not an expert nor have i been doing this long im also rather poor if you wish to award this post please also buy a gme share or something at gamestop obligatory emoji 🚀 obligatory position gme shares $ avg before i get into this i need to say two things first one shorters will keep shorting theyre in too deep second they will also do their absolute best to make anyone else sell or short too and theyve had years of practice on how to manipulate people reason gme is a mallstore blockbuster no future will cite earnings reports please see this very extensive due diligence dd along with this fascinating new development gme is on a trajectory to do some pretty cool things even without the short squeeze that has everyone excited long buyers are in ampxb most likely things they will cite are total sales declined in the holiday sales report large rd quarter sales declines precovid vs postcovid the most likely cause closed of stores which they did to cut underperforming stores and because their stores are far too dense especially given an increased focus on ecommerce ampxb most likely things they will intentionally leave out comparable store sales increased in holiday report so decrease likely because of store closures ecommerce is at of company sales equivalent to best buy percentage and growing rapidly and more rapidly than best buy regional sales in australianew zealand no covid went up ampxb reason insiders are selling this is true but here are the facts that they will leave out hestia capital whose managing member is wolf kurt james sold shares of gme for this reason in order to better align with the maximum concentration guidelines for single stock investment of hestia capital the fund still owns shares and wolf kurt james personally and directly still owns including of his wifes shares also dunn lizabeth sold shares of gme she still owns raul j fernandez sold shares of gme he still owns kathy p vrabeck sold shares of gme she still owns the forms regarding the previous peoples sales were all filed by dunn lizabeth suggesting that they sold as a coordinated choice also all three of those people are not on the board of directors as proposed by rc ventures and conditionally agreed to by gamestop an agreement theyll almost definitely keep given the huge increases in share price upon rc ventures buyin and policy changes that rc ventures has strongly suggestedrecommended source sec filings ampxb reason this is a pump and dump sneaky nonsense by wsb first lol the people on this sub dont have anything like that sort of buying power especially not if we take out the people that actually believe in gamestop more importantly see reason especially the part about outstanding short interest ampxb reason the short squeeze has already happened now here i expect them to throw up some really shady data analysis looking at shares shorted or available to short or short interest of daily trading and try and pretend like that number really means that the shorts have already covered heres the important data theres some in the dd in as well first short interest was higher than float as of eod friday meaning it would take days of trading to cover well see updated numbers for tuesday soon short interest actually increased during the wedthurs time that citron will likely try to say was the short squeeze now these are ortex estimates based on the selfreported shares short at a large aggregate of brokerages but have been very reliable when compared to the official sec data that comes out every half a month the point being that it is extremely extremely likely that shorts have not covered and have in fact doubled down on shorting to drive down the price meanwhile it is further likely that long buyers have locked in more shares so the real shortfloat is higher than we would expect on the assumption that every float share is really not locked down ampxb reason i expect this to be a meme reason cuz they had and needed to make it sound good but otherwise itll be an extension of reason or something to do with sec regulations or something nonsensical will update to respond if necessary so what will happen this is a guess but based on the sudden vanishing of shares available to short at ikbr at approximately the same time as the citron announcement i suspect tomfoolery in addition citron just started doing these twitter live things two days ago yes gme wasnt the first one but its still a very recent new thing at the same time gme has had some barefaced manipulation these past few days on this sub and elsewhere in the media not to mention the likely months of naked shorting option we have a repeat of friday where shorters will try to immediately and early smash down gme price in hopes that it will keep going down after starting that trajectory they can do this because sec rule expires after today so they can short on a downtick again option shorters will first allow stocks to rise as they did today then at around hour gme will start to tank if it was me i would time it and hit it very hard so it hits for the day the furthest they can push it by shorting on downticks as close to the citron announcement as possible with the hopes that that livestream will then push retail shorters to short more or paperhanders to sell this is all assuming no input from ryan cohen or gme so any kind of announcement or tweet would throw a wrench in my predictions especially if option is right and they timed it for a midmorning peak before the citron

l1h5g7,GME,302.34%,gme from a squeeze perspective on wednesday trading day not long term dd perspective,Discussion,46,1,tropicalsecret,258,looking at todays trading day was going to be what i think was the real test to see how much longer a squeeze could take i dont know the exact timing but here are some observations that i observe the sec rule was lifted today which means the shorts had an opportunity to drive the price down as much as they could there wasnt a significant drive down as of today by pm this makes me believe one of two thing yesterdays reports that there are no more shares to short are true which makes be believe that the shorts also took a long position at some point to hedge against to much upward loss which if you have that kind of money in play is both smart to do and feasible so now they are burning through those shares to make us run out of steam and give up i think this because if you look at volume spikes today the stock goes up at significant increased volume spike and then slowly goes down from there it looks like they are trying to match the buys and sells so the stock price stagnant i dont know how much stocks they have long to be able to do this but around half of the days volume has to be a sell if the price is somewhat flat thats a significant amount of shares if thats the case so who actually knows how much inventory they have less my assumption is not many in this scenario its just a matter of time until they run out of steam if stocks continue to be purchased or people hold the shares they still have available shares to short and we just dont know it even though we have the reports that there arent any theres a chance that they are wrong because today is flat means they didnt use all the short shares available this makes me think that they are going to try to get the price to go down tomorrow as a coordinated attempt during or after the shitron live twitter event what they will try and do is spook the retail investors who dont have the guts for volatility to sell at the same time then they use the rest of the available short shares and maybe sell the rest of their long shares all at the same time that will spook other people and then a mass sale happens driving the price of the stock down to me this could be a very real threat not sure what to do in this scenario but im sure somebody who is much much more experienced than me knows how to navigate please please please comment below i would assume that the longs need to know not to sell no matter what happens and rally one last time and buy up the rest of the shares hopefully management knows this threat and also has a plan of their own further thought of the situation i think the shorts were forced to come up with some kind of pr thats going to scare people if they didnt do that and then colluded together without that event it would be deliberate market manipulation but if they can piggyback on retail selling out they can get away with pulling an all out attack luckily for retail they did give us a heads up of an event which gives retail the time to come up with its own plan on how to defend retail can do what everybody has been saying dont sell also as shareholders and now there is a lot of you you can suggest that gamestop corporate come up with a strategy as well or ask them to release some more info on their plans for the future and such gamestop already has a bunch of press right now and some sorta news can be really good to combat what could happen tomorrow as a public company they have to have its investors in its best interest since a short seller is not technically an investor yet they havent physically bought shares like all of us we might be able to nudge corporate in the right direction maybe send an email or give gamestop corporate a call and ask nicely for some news tomorrow game stop investor relations phone number gamestop investor relations email address investorrelationsgamestopcom that info was found directly on their website remember ask nicely retail may be autists but we are good people we are currently saving a company from bankruptcy if you own share or million shares of gamestop stock youre considered an owner of game stop wsb to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2021-01-20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l1h5g7/gme_from_a_squeeze_perspective_on_wednesday_119/,1611118800

l1k8lo,None,N/A,gamma watch of popular tickers roundup,DD,17,0.81,Unlucky-Prize,182,due to the growing size of the sub weve been causing more gamma squeeze events on stocks gme last week bb monday gamma is an option term what it means in this context is the amount of stock someone short the options would need to buy or sell to hedge their position as price moves for wsb popular stocks i believe that about of all options were sold by dealers to you degenerates which means that the dealer is now short gamma which is not a superhero movie involving dwarves that means that as prices move dealers have to madly buy or sell stocks in the direction of the price movement so as not to lose money because option dealersmarket makers always win almost this means that in some situations moving over a gamma ramp price where theres a lot of gamma may be many times easier than in areas without a lot of gamma this in turn makes a gamma squeeze where dealers are forced to buy or sell stock so as to not lose money similar to short squeeze which is when shorts are forced to buy causing yet more buying so as to not lose more money in most cases gamma is not a meaningful effect on a stock close to zero but it can be a big deal in bbs case i think as much as of the stock bought on monday was dealers and the weak rally today is evidence of that no gamma ramp gme is similar passed a huge gamma ramp to get to the s last week with dealers doing of the buying now kind of in between several gamma ramps with dead zones and looking at gamma can help you guys understand what price actions are possible its a giant lever that can go against you or for you if price is slightly above a gamma ramp its bearish because small amounts of selling can crash the price quickly if the price is slightly below a gamma ramp its bullish because small buying can cause the price to run up the ramp while your downside is insulated by little forced selling by the dealers note that when you buy new options from dealers they just do the trade you do initially buy a put they sell stock buy a call they buy stock but from there price moves cause them to match the stock price movement they remove some of their short when price goes up and they sold you a put and they enlarge their long when the price goes up and they sold you a call make sense thought not work on your reading comprehension guys if you are trading complex derivatives with your life savings keep in mind that in a lot of cases theres no meaningful gamma and no price action will occur i prepared today gamma outlooks on some of the most mentioned stocks gme bb pltr iclntsla tlry nio note that this tool assumes that calls are long gamma for dealers and puts are short gamma i think when you guys engage a stock its more like of all gamma is short gamma put or call thetagang shows up and gives them some long gamma current popular stock gamma landscapes imgur has been a bit wonky lately hopefully its loading gamma is only relevant relative to float big gamma matters more on small stocks you will form your own opinions and trade accordingly and if this sub lately is any indication youll read all information as uber bullish for the stock you yoloed on but here are my interpretations coldly reading the data gme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 relevance very high big swings could cause mms to buysell of floating shares easily reading bearish with bearish trend but possibility of strong bull case on good bid there is a lot of gamma ramp and looking at the picture we are more on top of the gamma than on bottom of the gamma it turns out that the bears favor the on top position w regards to gamma people have added a lot of bearish bets in the past few days in the form of puts under this price which are fuel for the fire down and can be seen in the graph as put positions a lot more gamma ramp on net below than above bulls should be secure if this stock can get to the low s and stay there if it starts moving down it will run fast and then slow down at then slow down again at good news is that because of all this new put vol the price action will be less naturally down in the base case as dealers dump their hedges as time goes forward pushing price up gradually bb 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 relevance high big swings could cause mms to buysell of floating shares reading bearish with bullish trend this was arguably bearish yesterday because we were at the top of a ramp since then peopl ehave establsihed a lot of new positions beginning to form a bullish ramp bad news can send this back to quickly but not much lower quickly accumulation of new calls should start to make moving up a possibility though if people keep buying pltr 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 relevance moderate float is theoretically a billion shares and swings could make mms buysell perhaps to of that reading slightly bullish theres a sharp ramp down but also up and a strong buying trend will move this up and theres large block of gamma at $ icln 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 relevance low why because this is an etf that can be madedestroyed by issuer on demand reading actually a little bullish this is so much gamma ahead of price that it will cause a couple hundred million dollars of clean energy buying on a decent day i

l6dnai,None,N/A,a new wave of disruptive hedge funds powered by democracy and autism an idea for the future of wall street bets,Discussion,13,0.71,SuperSexyStocks,29,intro with what has happened the past week i have been brainstorming ways we can turn this into longterm change in the finance field last night i read a tweet from the one and only chamath palihapitiya in which he states that there was some interest in investing in a small disruptive fund where autists would be selected to trade k each at first i really liked the raw idea but then i started thinking about what makes rwsb a disruptive force in the financial world i came to the conclusion that wsb has always been successful because of our numbers we crowdsource our research through dd posts and release it to the masses what makes us a force to be reckoned with is the fact that all million members have instant access to this research that historically has been blocked by ridiculous paywalls and obscured by complex lingo to deter the average person after thinking back on this i felt that giving k to individuals would not accurately represent the reason we are successful i do believe these people would certainly be successful however our growing community will fail to be represented surprisingly under all of the memes and names this community is one of the biggest supporters of groundbreaking tech we collectively agree not to value companies like tesla based on boomer fundamentals instead we create value through how a company or ceo can change the world think about it without all of us tsla would be unable to break through the ceiling of old school hedge funds shorts giving individuals money to trade would not accurately transfer our power and influence to a legitimate fund and therefore be unable to disrupt the financial sector in a meaningful way ampxb thesis in my opinion the only way we can forge our path into the future is through organizing and crowdsourcing our wealth of knowledge into a fund and allow all longterm wsb users think one year of activity vote on how invested money should be allocated based on dd posts the dd posts that would be voted on would be selected directly off of wsb by a small group of selected popular individuals ie udeepfuckingvalue we would be seen by most as a young group of investors changing the way the average person invests it should go without saying that all of our trades would be posted along with the dd to support the trade by the startup this gives the average autist an organized place to view and learn about highlevel trades that are deemed reputable by intelligent site regulars ampxb conclusion honestly this idea was just a brainstorming project for me im only a college student so even though i think i know everything the reality is i dont im not sure if this idea will be feasible or if its even legal according to sec regulations if it is against sec law i would love to hear ways we could transform the idea to comply my main goal is to have this foster future discussion on the future of wsb and finance as a history buff i know that democracy is the product of human innovation and i see a democratic hedge fund as the natural progression of the financial world note from op might end up being a dogshit idea if you think it is roast me in the comments please just also add why its a bad idea to foster discussion thanks,2021-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6dnai/a_new_wave_of_disruptive_hedge_funds_powered_by/,1611723600

l6e73y,AMC,89.92%,clearing the air on “amc being the next gme short squeeze” this post explains why the two are different,Discussion,463,0.9,Yabberdabberdooo,426,a lot of people are creating vast amounts of hype around amc being the next “gme” im here to clear the air on why that isnt the case the key difference between the two is the short positions whilst its true that amc also has a large short interest it is nothing compared to gme what separates gme is the percentage of shorts against the float which is approximately this meant that short sellers had no where to go when things started to go south for them i will explain why later amc has a large short interest however its approximately which gives the short sellers a large position to exit which given the hype surrounding gme is very likely after today why does this difference matter well with gme the short sellers have already borrowed shares and are required to buy back those shares at market value when one of the following triggers activates they close their position their margin gets called and they are forced to their short positions expire when a trigger activates the amount of shares they borrowed is then purchased at market rate if the shares arent available then price goes up rapidly trading is suspended usually and this gives time for investors to set a sell price rinse and repeat until all shares owed are paid back with gme having more than short interest this means that stock is going to have to change hands numerous times to pay back the investors during this period the stock price will be huge and there will be many trading stops all of the money for this price increase will be coming from the short sellers and htere can be no bag holders unless you really are retarded because the stock is being returned to the original investor and they were paid interest by the short sellers anyway so they cant complain with amc there is a large window for short sellers to exit and therefore cannot be squeezed as hard smart short sellers will be closing their positions today or after today causing a pump because they are buying shares to close their positions the recirculated gme hype investment will also cause a pump and with no end game squeeze in sight the stock will be left floating in a bubble which will eventually pop leaving many retail investors as bag holders you cannot squeeze every short position in the market gme is special because the institutions taunted us and exposed themselves by being reckless it wont happen again you arent squeezing anyone but yourselves in amc be at your own risk tldr gme squeeze is real amc squeeze is fictional edit im not saying amc is worthless im saying it isnt the next gme i also have no short or put positions in amc i have nothing for or against it merely pointing out the differences for new people,2021-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6e73y/clearing_the_air_on_amc_being_the_next_gme_short/,1611723600

l6novm,None,N/A,the real dd on slv the worlds biggest short squeeze is possible and we can make history,DD,516,0.84,TheHappyHawaiian,6099,here is the longer dd for the short squeeze case for slv a followup from my shorter post a few hours ago first things first dont do this until the gme rise is done lets conquer one market at a time i am long gme but am going long slv immediately after if you just want to know what to buy skip to the end i present investment dds in this post the short squeeze and the fundamentals if you want to see what to buy the short squeeze buy slv shares and call options to force physical delivery of silver to the slv vaults the silver futures market has oscillated between having roughly and ratio of paper traded silver to physical silver but lets call it for now this means that for every ounces in open interest in the futures market only actually gets delivered most traders would rather settle with cash rather than take delivery of thousands of ounces of silver and have to figure out to store and transport it in the future the people naked shorting silver via the futures markets are a couple of large banks and making them pay dearly for their over leveraged naked shorts would be incredible its not melvin capital on the other side of this trade its jp morgan time to get some payback for the bailouts and manipulation theyve done for decades look up silver manipulation fines that jpm has paid over the years the way we create the squeeze is by forcing a much higher percentage of the futures contracts to actually deliver physical silver there is very little silver in the comex vaults or available to actually be use to deliver and if they have to start buying en masse on the open market they will drive the price massively higher there is no way to magically create more physical silver in the world that is ready to be delivered with a stock you can eventually just issue more shares if the price rises too much but this simply isnt the case here the futures market is kind of the wild west of the financial world real commodities are being traded and if you are short you literally have to deliver thousands of ounces of silver per contract if the holder on the other side demands it if you remember oil going negative back in may that was possible because futures are allowed to trade to their true value they arent halted and thats what will make this so fun when the true squeeze happens the silver market is much larger than gme in terms of notional value but there is very little physical silver actually readily available think about the difference between total shares and the shares in the active float for a stock and the paper silver trading hands in the futures market is hundreds of times larger than what is available thus when they are forced to actually deliver physical silver it will create a massive short squeeze where an absurd amount of silver will be sought after to fulfill their contractually obligated delivery with very little available to actually buy they are naked shorting silver and will have to cover all at once and the float as a percentage of the total silver stock globally is truly miniscule the fundamentals the current gold to silver ratio is meaning the price of gold per ounce is times the price of silver naturally occurring silver is only times as common as gold so this ratio of is quite high until the early th century silver prices were pegged at a ratio to gold in the us because this ratio was relatively known even then in terms of current production the ratio is even lower at meaning we are only producing ounces of silver for each newly produced ounce of gold we have been able to get away with producing so little new silver for so long because governments have dumped silver on the market for years but now their silver vaults are empty at the end of ww government vaults globally contained billion ounces of silver but as we moved to fiat currency and away from precious metal backed currencies the amount held by governments has decreased to only billion ounces as they dumped their supply into the market but this dumping is done now as their remaining supply is basically nil this billion ounces represents only of the total supply of only billion ounces stored as investment globally this means that of that gold is held privately by institutions and by millions of boomer gold and silver bugs who have been sitting on meager gains for decades these boomers arent going to sell no matter what because they see their silver cache as part of their doomsday prepper supplies its locked away in bunkers they built miles from their house we are about get years worth of their gains in months if we do this correctly the reason that only ounces of silver are produced for every ounce of gold in todays world is because there arent really any good naturally occurring silver deposits left in the world silver is more common than gold in the earths crust but it is spread very thin thus nearly every ounce of silver produces is actually a byproduct of mining for other metals such as gold or copper this means that even as the silver price skyrockets it wont be easy to increase the supply of silver being produced even if new mines were to be constructed it could take years to come online finally most of this newly created silver supply each year is used for productive purposes rather than kept for investment it is used in electronics solar panels and jewelry for the most part this demand wont go away if the silver price rises so the short sellers will be trying to get their hands on a very small slice of newly minted silver the solar market is also growing quickly and political pressure to increase solar and electric vehicles could provide more industrial demand ampxb what to buy i will be putting directly into slv shares and into the $ strike slv calls expiring this way we create a groundswell into silver immediately that then rockets through a gamma squeeze as slv approaches $ price target of $ for slv by end of april if we pull this off alternate options buying physical silver this also works but you pay a premium to buy and sell so its less efficient and you take fewer silver ounces off of the market because of the premium you pay going long futures for february or march if you are a rich bastard and can actually take physical delivery of s of ounces of silver by all means do so but if you simply settle for cash you are actually part of the problem we need actual physical delivery which is what slv demands and is why slv is the way to go unless you are going to take delivery miners do not buy miners as part of this trade miners will absolutely go up if slv goes up but buying them doesnt create the squeeze in the actual silver market furthermore most silver miners only derive of their revenue from silver anyways so eventually slv will outperform them as it gets high enough and each marginal slv dollar only increases miner profits by a smaller and smaller percentage details on slv physical settlement when slv issues shares the custodian is forced to true up their vaults with the proportional amount of silver daily from the slv prospectusan investment in shares is backed by silver held by the custodian on behalf of the trust the shares are backed by the assets of the trust the trustees arrangements with the custodian contemplate that at the end of each business day there can be in the trust account maintained by the custodian no more than ounces of silver in an unallocated form the bulk of the trusts silver holdings is represented by physical silver identified on the custodians or if applicable subcustodians books in allocated and unallocated accounts on behalf of the trust and is held by the custodian in london new york and other locations that may be authorized in the future join me brothers lets take silver to the moon and take on the biggest and baddest manipulators in the world

l6o99e,None,N/A,safe for work an open letter to cnbc and its contributors through either ignorance or bad faith you are getting this wrong,Discussion,134,0.96,Noob_Noodles,323,ladies and gentlemen and everyone in between strap in because were going to use real words for this one i speak for myself here and no one else and no one else here speaks for everyone else either cnbc whether its true or not the past days have made everyone honestly believe that you are truly bought out by wall street in every sense youve paraded “analyst” after analyst hedge fund manager after manager boomer after boomer to try and demonize and deflect blame for the gamestop situation firstly your contributors need to stop pretending they dont know short squeeze mechanics youve had dozens of people on your air whining about how no one in rwallstreetbets cares about fundamentals and valuation regarding gamestop of course we dont care about gmes fundamentals anymore because we are in a squeeze we are in a squeeze in which the shorts have doubleddown constantly that means of course the price keeps going into the stratosphere do you actually believe your own lie that the shorts like melvin have closed out i dont and we have data that agrees why would we sell our shares “fair value”” if the squeeze isnt done secondly most of us are well aware that gme isnt a $billion company or whatever $share is i think we are all very much aware that we are in the middle of a short squeeze not price discovery this does not mean that our interest in gme was not a valuebased thesis at first our most famous gme long u deepfkingvalue has been in gme since there are others here who im sure joined at some point way back when if you want more credibility the famous michael burry and some dudebro donald foss both entered large positions in gme a long time ago these people believed in the future value of gme they saw that savage unrelenting short sellers like melvin had pounded the share price into the ground actively and immorally aiming for bankruptcy retail bought in in september because ryan cohen saw enough value to buy stock the price jumped to $share in november because ryan cohen expressed his vision for a turnaround that people saw value in the big spike happened when cohen n co joined the board of directors at gme why are your hosts and “analysts” pretending that these things didnt happen and the whole while melvin and shorts were doubling down on their positions which were already part of the preposterous irresponsible and potentially illegal short interest and even now as far as we know the short interest is still over stop pretending that these things did not happen youve had people constantly claiming that the prices are reaching these levels “for no reason” and that the initial bullish sentiment was created “out of thin air” the people who keep saying these things including your hosts are either willfully ignorant or acting in bad faith good decent people provided their due diligence on this subreddit they pointed out the $billion in revenue in they pointed out the ecommerce sales tripling yoy they pointed out the ability to easily pay off debt they even called hundreds of gamestops where we found out they were constantly selling out of inventory and have plans of having pcbuildingstations instore they pointed out the rapidly expanding gaming market and the ability to grab substantial market share and yes they pointed out the short interest but people did not start buying $gme solely because of short interest smart or not honest people here bought into gme initially as a value play they did their homework they found data they showed prove of positions this brings me to my third point in the entire time if have been on wallstreetbets we have never “targeted” a stock or hedge fund just to bust the shorts shortbusting is not who wsb those are the kids on tiktok or the grifters on twitter every single popular thesis on here has been backed up with research financial analysis and quality depending on who you ask discussion just because we talk like stupid people doesnt mean we dont say smart things and maybe our ideas do end up backfiring see $prpl and maybe of the members dont know what theta decay is but we do not pull stocks out of thin air as youve claimed people here genuinely believe in these stocks people here believe in ryan cohen and the potential for gamestop to be reinvented people believe in blackberrys future present as a rock solid software company this brings me to my final issue it is disingenuous and plainly incorrect to blame every single price increase on the “reddit rebellion” and short squeezes stop saying we are going after $bbby – there hasnt been a substantive post in months on that stop saying we are pumping $nok – weve advocated for leap calls in nok for months because we know we cannot wait out their giant share float and for jpows sake stop blaming us for amovie companymc exclothing storepr and irbt two of those tickers are literally banned from this subreddit and the other isnt even real to us we cant even type them into a post without getting autodeleted people who try to pump a stock for no reason are banned yes because of the events of this month and because of the actions of groups like citron many people are happily engaging in one particular short squeeze but thats it yes retail is more powerful than you may know but we are not that powerful if you or anyone else reading this are wondering why there seems to be more internet chatter on that one particular movie company hear this someone has been creating fake accounts and bots to spam and pump up movie company and $nok etc to distract from gme ask the admins look at chamaths twitter replies look at all of finance twitter there are newly created accounts and bots spamming the hell out of these other stocks in an effort to manipulate the market and save the shorts jeez i wonder who is behind that could it be the same group of people who bought $million of gme puts right before tweeting something if anyone in the void is reading this thanks the point of this post was just to fight back in a tiny way against the days and days of whining millionaires on tv berating people they literally know nothing about its to point out the ignorance of selfserving boomers saying things like “the sec needs to regulate the reddit” etc the point of this post was just to get our little corner of truth out there in the world because we all know that truth is in short supply

l6kd9m,GME,7.01%,fundamental justification for gme current price and future pt upward of and where the top will be,DD,1216,0.98,horny131313,726,hello my friends this is why gme stock shares are fundamentally fair valued at ampxb today on cnbc the shills and hedge fund puppets were asking show me the white papers to justify the current price of gme blah blah blah show me the fundamentals well i am going to do just that now there are many ways to value a company from dcf models only to speculating growth opportunities pvgo etc and while those are somewhat complicated youre in luck you dont actually need to know them this is what cnbc is getting wrong as they are looking inward into gmes books looking for a justification for their value jk theyre shills but lets pretend they deserve the benefit of the doubt they need to be looking at the value of a share as an independent entity it is no secret we have departed from any type of traditional fundamental valuation ampxb to understand how to fundamentally value gme we must look to the futures market and their fundamentals and view gme shares of stock as a commodity like many commodities especially produce gourds steel oil etc there is one force that drives the entirety of the speculative futures markets supply and demand supply and demand in the futures market fundamental analysts will use their knowledge of supply and demand factors to create their opinion of whether the futures contract is fairly valued and if price will increase or decrease that is exactly what is going on with gme and why the stock is and will continue to go up the current stock price is not based on the financials of gme but on the concrete knowledge that there is impossible demand and finite supply again the stock price of gme is fundamentally fair valued because of supply and demand the driving force of commodity futures markets there is concrete knowledge of impossible demand and finite supply when speculators have reason to believe that ornamental gourd supply will be very low and middle aged white women will be itching to get their hands on some to make their kitchen table thanksgiving centerpiece aka when supply is very low they have good reason to believe that the price for gourds will be higher than normal this is amplified by the fact that short positions need to pay interest if they do not find supply those with short positions will be killed through bankruptcy if they do not cover what is happening with gme is the same thing that happens when life saving drugs are marked up s of s people will pay for them because they have to edit dont compare gme to life saving drugs asshole i am not saying that gme is a life saving drugs or that gme is more important than insulin or any other retarded conclusion you smooth brains can jump to i am saying that as a function of supply and demand since demand outweighs supply and since there are extreme consequences for not having enough supply to keep up with demand then people will pay exorbitant prices to meet demand same goes with food if youre starving water if you are about to die of thirst etc go get offended at something else ampxb so where is the top the same place it is for life saving drugs of course the absolute highest they could be without exhausting the need for supply or in laymans terms the i know that you can and will pay for this so that you dont die even if it means living from paycheck to paycheck price but horny what number will that price be nobody has any fucking idea remember risk here is literal infinity i am talking brokers having to liquidate their entire market positions because stock brokers and brokerage firms can be held liable for negligence and allowing unhedged naked shorting over of total float is negligent obviously this would destroy the market gamestop would be like a black hole that sucked everything in with it and regulators will not allow that to happen there will be a forced top at some point but we are not nearly there tldr read the big text also i am not saying gme with its assets future growth is worth bil i am saying that the shares themselves are fairly valued based soley on supply and demand,2021-01-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6kd9m/fundamental_justification_for_gme_current_price/,1611723600
l6kgik,None,N/A,explanation for noobs who dont quite understand whats going on,DD,1498,0.99,myne,1833,mods does dd tag apply if not change it i wrote this in response to someone elsewhere who asked simply gt so theyre betting against the company like they have no faith in them investing like this makes one feel horrible yeah there are three ways you can short you buy an option with a predetermined end date with the right to sell a stock at a certain price depending on how much you want to pay determines the price if a stock is $ and you expect it to drop to $ in months you might buy a $ month expiry put right to sell at price option this might cost you c per share if youre even slightly right ie it drops to any price lower than $ before expiry you made c per share you can also change your mind and sell the option either more profit or less loss than cshare if youre properly right and it does drop to exactly $ you make $ per share if it rises or drops to any number above $ you lose the price of the option cshare youre a big player you call your buddies at pension fund x and say hey can i borrow those shares you have for x interest and return them to you later a set timeframe may be set i dont know for sure but probably anyhow pension fund x says ok because they arent looking to sell them so might as well make some interest on lending them so you borrow them and immediately sell them you pay your daily interest to the pension fund and you wait when the price drops and you decide that youve made enough you buy them back and return them you keep the difference in prices whatever that may be minus the interest if youre wrong youre still obliged to return the shares to pension fund x so at some point you have to decide to eat a loss and buy the shares back youre a big player and you are ok with a bit of lawbreaking you naked short sell this is great because its cheaper no interest payments here you simply sell shares you dont have and buy the imaginary shares you just created back later so that the number of shares on issue doesnt get too far out of whack and you dont get investigated any gap between your sell price and buy price is profit or loss depending on which way it goes whats happened right now is mostly a combination of and im sure there is a bit of but only causes predictable losses like the cost of playing a hand at a casino you only lose the amount you bet if the cards dont go your way so the risk with and is that because youre obliged to buy back the shares at some point if they go up when you have to quit you have to pay the current market price and your actions can make the price go up even more now youre in a short squeeze you are obliged to buy but the price keeps going up every time you do its entirely possible that others see the price going up and buy so youre now competing to buy a limited number of shares with everyone else so the price goes higher your losses are potentially infinite whats slightly different between this particular short squeeze and all the others is the dumb fucks naked short sold at least more shares than ever existed theyre obliged to buy back more shares than is possible the only way out of that selfmade trap is a complicated mess of desperately buying returning rebuying from the people you borrowed them from and returning them with losses at every step imagine if i sold you cars but only delivered youre standing there with your wtf face and i say hey how much would you sell those cars for you can name your price at this point i pay it then i finish my car delivery retail traders are acting as one single semicoordinated hive loosely behaving similarly to what would in prior short squeezes be a competitor hedge fund they own a lot of the shares the hedge funds hfs need to buy but theyre not selling theyre actively cheering for the hfs bankruptcy while watching the price of the stock they hold skyrocket only other hf billionaires are allowed to do that and get away with it a hfs can be negotiated with if youre really really getting bent over and fucked and you grovel enough you can usually cut a deal where they stop trying to fuck you if they wont talk to you theyll often talk to your bankbrokersome other bigger player that can convince them that your bankruptcy will also cause significant losses or bankruptcy of another party theyre not trying to fuck and they might like to have as friends one day you quit this and well owe you one its always good to have favours to call b the self proclaimed retards on wsb cant be negotiated with they dont need favours they dont care if you go bankrupt or theres collateral damage they dont give a fuck about any of them for the most part they only hold a few hundred shares each max and also for the most part theyre playing with their own money that they can actually afford to lose even if it hurts for a year or two how do you negotiate with or swat a million wasps stinging you you

l6essv,None,N/A,dd market macro and why money multipliers will print tendies also cnbc are fucking sell out shills,DD,83,0.97,TheFaggotMagnet,34,🚀🚀🚀alright you smooth brain fucks sit down grab your sippy cup and get your wifes boyfriend to strap you in because the market macros are going to shoot gme up like a fat kid cannonballing his nuts into orbit🚀🚀🚀 you heard that right the macro fundamentals are going to shoot gme up udeepfuckingvalue is a god and all the other dd is mostly legit but theres something no one is talking about money multipliers if you dont know what it is it doesnt matter but you might as well know why this ship aint stopping what is a money multiplier money makers banks and institutional investors create value in the economy that normies like us cant they take your money and stocks and instead of letting them sit those greedy fucks reinvest to turn a quick buck on money that isnt theirs but it doesnt stop there the next big boy that gets their hand on that moneystock reinvests that too so at the end of the day that $ you invested can become $ even though you get returns on only $ and take legitimate risk now is this illegal no does this create value in the market yes its called a money multiplier now you know for the normies this action multiplies the value of money in the market for the apes your dollar becomes they take your dollar and turn it into give you back your dollar at the end give another dollar to the ceo of cockhead hedge fund and then profit that third dollar if you dont understand that thats okay we still accept you but daddy i want tendies strap that belt and listen before i pull mine out all major investment institutions engage in these practices it is standard the degree is variable but the practice is standard this means that all institutions are connected why because all these institutions are creating value from point of value that traces through all the institutions involved you invest dollar your broker reinvests that dollar into another security hedge fund dickweed invests that dollar to another fund sister fucker fund invests that dollar to melvin melvin is broke like my dad after we got fucked in and cant do shit with it lol hows it feel but what happens when you pull that dollar out its gone no one gets that value so in general there are millions upon millions of investments predicated on money multipliers this creates a giant web where all banks and hedge funds are connected because if a few big boys go out so do their values which decrease the value of the market and decrease the value of the entire economy if a major player who acts as a money multiplier goes out this means the chain is altered and the total amount of value in the economy drops ie prices go down because there is less value in the economy which lowers prices everywhere and finally lowers a private institutions buying power look at it this way if of all money got taken out of the stock market what would happen the fall in prices would be much bigger than because dollar can be used to create the value this would lead to a fall bigger than of value and people would be spooked pulling out even more real dollars which would lead to a decrease greater than the cash they pull out because the money multiplier effect is also taken away and guess what that leads to no not tendies dipshit that causes more people to pull out and that is a self fulfilling prophecy this is what it means to be too big to fail understood i know i know how do we make tendies off of this just wait this isnt new information this is basic undergraduate economic shit the big chunkers and i mean big chunkers think of your major banks and investment institutions know not to get fucked in these webs after they know how fucked everyone would be if they got caught bagholding this because it would reverberate everywhere because they really influence the economy but they dont care about you they know that if they are fucked itll affect their values and they dont want that what does this mean theyll act like they can continually extend credit and try to salvage their friends shorts but they cant they know that even if they want to they cant come to help their poor fallen rich friends because if they do theyre screwed even more and theyre going to screw all of their other rich friends too if they end up

l6os3d,GME,-54.43%,the $gme short thesis and how it could backfire if retail investors behave rationally,Discussion,229,0.86,o0DrWurm0o,590,so im seeing a lot of information out here about melvin and days to cover and all that and i think a lot of it is outdated actually i know its outdated because people were saying the same thing a week ago and $gme has risen like since then theres been a huge amount of price action and yet the shorts everyone has been talking about have exited their positions and theres still tons of short interest what gives why havent the shorts learned their lesson are they just stupid maybe but maybe not lets consider the shorts view on this situation the $gme short thesis as of heres the scene a stock which is widely regarded as colossally overvalued has doubled in value several times within a matter of weeks you know that the retail investor plan is to force shorts into a squeeze scenario however volume is up to unprecedented levels as new traders flood into the market to get in on the action so the days to cover is falling making it easier for shorts to get out quickly when they get a window meanwhile older long retail investors aka bought like a day ago are staring at what are to them very nice gains its been several days of insane price action already and people are predicting the end is near because well it must be right the uncertainty and perceived risk of losing unrealized profits are very high you look at this and predict the following retail investors who have made tidy profits will sell upon a volatility move causing a chain reaction of selloffs in other words you expect that the bubble is gonna pop upon sharp price action could be either way and then theres going to be a sharp decline as retail investors scramble to take whatever profits they can before the next guy sells at a higher price so what do you do as a short with that thesis short the stock of course even if theres tremendous upwards price action the next day you can just sell short again pay off the old loan with the new short money and now youre in an even better position your best bet as a short is to short the stock the moment before the bubble pops high interest rates from your lender dont bother you because based on the thesis youre only holding your loan for a few days and the share price on the other side is going to be way below where you shorted this is why short interest is still strong its generally a good play to short a bubble that you expect to pop soon how the short thesis could fall apart so the whole short thesis is based upon the idea that retail investors are going to close out their $gme positions very abruptly as soon as they see some nice gains and sense that the end is near but heres the thing what if they dont as an investor in $gme myself i did the following with my gains i sold a portion of them to cover my initial cost basis and now im just sitting on the rest as house money im not buying in anymore because im managing risk but im not pulling out because i think theres more juice to squeeze and ive got a lot of cushioning below if the price does start dropping if this strategy is broadly applied by other retail investors and its a pretty classic and intuitive investinggambling strategy volume will slow down and the price will generally plateau so as a short arent you happy that the price stopped rising hell no you need that price to either fall so you can close at a profit or rise sharply so you can roll your position up $gme remaining tremendously overvalued at a steady price for a long time would be horrible for you as a short youve taken out a huge loan youre paying huge interest and there seems to be no end in sight this is how shorts playing volatility are forced to close at big losses when the interest over time eats up all of their potential profits before volatility strikes i think this is the scenario in which wed see a true moass disclaimer i am just a guy on the internet i dont have specialized education in the market but i think this is a pretty plausible thesis for the continued short interest and how the moass might develop i could be totally wrong let me know what you think about it in the comments positions shares $gme avg cost basis,2021-01-28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6os3d/the_gme_short_thesis_and_how_it_could_backfire_if/,1611810000

l6omry,None,N/A,an open letter to melvin capital cnbc boomers and wsb,Discussion,1017,0.98,ssauronn,8637,mods do not delete this is important to me please read ampxb i was in my early teens during the crisis i vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on wall street had in my personal life and the lives of those close to me i was fortunate my parents were prudent and a little paranoid and they had some food storage saved up when that crisis hit our family we were able to keep our little house but we lived off of pancake mix and powdered milk and beans and rice for a year ever since then my parents have kept a food storage and they keep it updated and fresh those close to me my friends and extended family were not nearly as fortunate my aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like my friends got to find out almost a year after the crisis low my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others he was hiring my friends dads for odd house work one of them built a new closet in our guest room another one did some landscaping in our backyard i will forever be so proud of my parents because in a time of need even when i have no doubt money was still tight they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it to melvin capital you stand for everything that i hated during that time youre a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the crisis were not punished and your blatant disregard for the law made obvious months ago through your for the melvin lawyers out there alleged illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you havent learned a single thing since and why would you your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions i bought shares a few days ago i dumped my savings into gme paid my rent for this month with my credit card and dumped my rent money into more gme which for the people here at wsb i would not recommend and im holding this is personal for me and millions of others you can drop the price of gme after hours $ im not going anywhere you can pay for thousands of reddit bots im holding you can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us i dont care im making this as painful as i can for you to cnbc you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions agenda is just that short term your staple audience will soon become too old to care and the millions of us not just at wsb but every person affected by the crash thats now paying attention to gme are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us and tried to tear down the little guys i know for sure ill remember this in response here is a list of cnbc sponsors and partners they include but are not limited to ibm cisco tmobile jpmorgan oracle and ziprecruiter their parent company is nbcuniversal owned by comcast and ge to the boomers andor people close to that age just now paying attention to these millennial blog posts you realize that even if you werent adversely effected by the crash your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were were not enemies were on the same side stop listening to the media thats making us out to be market destroyers and start rooting for us because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago and were taking that opportunity your children your grandchildren might have suffered as i described because of the institutions that were fighting against you really want to choose them over your own family and friends were not asking you to risk your k or retirement fund on a single gme bet were just asking you to be understanding supportive and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago to wsb you all are amazing i imagine that im not the only one that this is personal for ive read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the crash whether youre here for the gains to stick it to the man as i am or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement thank you each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance

l8ryb4,GME,-51.27%,i might make usd a month but im holding gme tiny reinforcement from asia and a story of how unfair things have been for me and others,Discussion,6,1,gogitossj3,30,this is gonna be a long story about all the unfairness i observed and endured from the both in corporate and the market im sorry if it bores you i saw that story from that dude that posted how his dad lost almost everything during and i wanted to share my own sorry for my bad english hello wsb i last post around half a year ago on how the us stock market helped me get closer to my dream of being able to support my family with an average country wage of usd a month i got a ton of encouragement and advices from everyone back then which i immensely appreciated now that the gme phenomenon has spreaded over the globe even here although we actually cannot help you guys without a lot of trouble like i went through more below so to recap i saved up usd ever since i was young uptil now im now working ever since i was in elementary school money was all i had in mind ever since our country got hit with the depression and my family was struggling backstory ive always loved pc and paid close attention to it so when their new ryzen series leaks start getting out in and i got to test them out while working part time i took a look at their stock it was trading at around i think so with my excitement i was eager to join the market i asked my uncle who was a stock investor and his reply was the market is rigged dont join it i was stumbed he lost a lot in maybe that was why so after a month of research it appears there is no legit way for me to invest in the us market or actually to any market aside our own our banks wouldnt even let us wire money overseas without a reason they deem acceptable but heres the thing the hedge funds here can that was the first unfair thing i witness about limiting the little guy ability to get somewhere in life in the end i couldnt find a way to get in and watched as amd make it meteoric rise over the past few years it was really depressing thinking back on how the profit couldve helped my family fast forward to i finally found a way to make a foreign account with td and have a friend overseas that can help me fund the account i just need to send him money through epayment the fees was high not to mention since we cant use ach because were transferring to td from his account it cost me somewhere a total of around usd for the money to land in my account but after all that i managed to get into the market i grinded through all the courses on td and read all the posts from various subs but life is never that smooth around that time i saw a post of a member on here using his profit to pay for another fellow member tuition that inspired me i wanted to do that so badly first for my brother the beer virus crash i joined the market at feb th yes right at the top before we drill straight through earth core because of the beer viruses i almost lost it all i switched between puts and calls as i see fit but in the end i came out with usd left i thought i was the unluckiest guy on earth it was tiring since were on opposite end of the timezone i usually finish school or work then trare until around or am all that and ending up with huge loss was devastating thinking back i shouldve pulled out when i was seeing my money losing everyday the corona started affecting our country we did a great job at handling it but i can tell my parents were fearing for their jobs i put myself back together and get back in with my slowly grinding up back to it was arduous but when i finally got back to breakeven it felt amazing because im not starting again im starting again with experience sadly by this time my father lost his job due to corporate politicsdirtyplay i wont get into details but basically there was some bad people doing bad things to try to frame others its been going on for years in the end he was proven innocent but the corporate still let him go to keep the image of the company and guess what he never get a job anymore no matter how many times he gets to those final interviews we both know that it was because they made him as scapegoat and whenever a new company contact his old one they would he put off to them its much better to scapegoat one person than to say we let a guy sabotaging our employees and company for years without being able to do anything after all the failed job opportunity he decided to give the stock market a try it was going well we dont have advance options and we also dont allow legal shorting here but as well soon find out its only a rule for us commoners basically shorting is not a thing here but hedgefunds or sharks can always call each other and borrow shares to short ive witness quite a few short ladder attack and since we dont have options we dont have the ability to buy puts to hedge our account but i am sure the big guy has their ways of getting them you can tell by this point i have a lot of bottled up contempt for suits gme and the global movement and that brings us to this unprecedented time i didnt get into gme soon enough gme shares at cost basis my money was tired up in spreade for bb and nok expiring last friday which was rather deep itm i had bb c and bb hit a peak of last week and as we all know by abusing their power yet again they tanked the price and those trades are now worthless but i held gme i held through their attacks when it tankee to because you guys were holding with me so now all i have is gme shares that i will hold until we can get back at them and when not if we win hopefully it will help me somewhat in investing in this market that hopefully will be a lot more fair after all of this a lot of people i know are asking to join and ive been helping them setting up accounts on tda or etoro etoro is faster to get started but they kinda suck since there are no way for us to get fractional shares etoro been wonky some of my friends are putting money together to hold one shares of gme on monday i look forward to the day we win this so many things are on the line not just for our generation but our previous and future generations not just for the us stock market but for all market as well as everything unfairness in the world in the end we might win the battle of gme but still not win much from this war of unfairness but thats a start so to conclude this stupid long tedtalk you have reinforcement from everywhere wsb even from places that cost months wages for a share lets make them pay for what they took from us and if possible my brother tuition also k per share is not a meme tldr poor kid from rd world country holding gme because suits treated his family badly position every penny in

l8ortf,PSA,13.29%,psa robinhood users mods please dont delete,DD,37,0.88,FUPeiMe,112,tldr i see a lot of talk about moving and less walk i believe that is partly due to misinformation about the ease of switching so please read if this applies to you let me start by saying the following people can sell when they want buy when they want and i have no agenda here regarding that i also dont work for any other platform and i really dont care which one you move to if you move at all i have read dozens of posts from robinhood users i am not a user of their platform that range from mild displeasure to fullon outrage i have read far fewer posts however about people actually initiating the process of moving to a better online brokerage option there are several but first lets cover some basics so that you are fully informed on how easy it is if you had started the process of moving on thursday when you should have youd probably be ready by tuesdaywednesday of this week so dont delay any further i read three main concerns each i will briefly address users think they have to sell their holdings first that is false users think they can only use one platform that is false users think the process is difficult or other brokerages cost money that is false you do not have to sell anything online brokerages gain and lose clients all the time and anything a transfer occurs it is very simple im finding this aspect of the posts so confusing because its just as easy to open a new account online at any of the big boy brokerages as it is with robinhood you simply go online answer questions and generally your account is open right away next youll need to fund the new account which you can do in several ways or a combo of a few you can link the new account to a checkingsavings account you have with a bank you can transfer assets unsold from an old account your new one and usually one or two other options i believe the term for transferring holdings from one brokerage to another is like kind transfer but if im wrong and somebody can correct me i will edit this post essentially if you own shares in many stocks or shares in just one stock the old brokerage simply transfers them to the new one it would be good to have the routing and account number handy from any account you wish to bring money from too if you dont know this simply call your bank first thing monday morning and ask or go to a branch or go look at the bottom of a check you have and find them there google which number is which so you get it right you can have multiple accounts with different brokerages an easier option may simply be to open a new account over the weekend with a different brokerage get the funds transfer started asap and as soon as the money is there then you can start buying whatever you want from your new account you can own x number of shares of a company in robinhood and y number of shares in that same company with a different brokerage this is generally what i find my peers to be doing im considered of boomer age by the wsb population and there are actually a number of reasons to do this i think in light of events from this week that point should be selfevident this process could not be easier and ironically robinhood amp others applied pressure years ago and now most accounts have free trading thats right my boomer vanguard account used to charge a commission for me to buysell stock now it is free similarly the commission on options has come down robinhood tricked you into thinking they were doing something different or better they actually werent and certainly now they arent caveat vanguards app sucks some of the other grownup brokerages apps are better and ive never used robinhood but ive seen a million screen shots and it seems that robinhood and similar brokerages did design easier platforms especially mobilebased platforms however when youve got thousands tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars at stake im dumbfounded why a user wouldnt want something less basic the transfer may cost you $ at most from what im reading but i think the move would be worth it but as i wrote above if you dont want to transfer then just open a new account and keep two open one that treats you like shit and tells what youre allowed to do with your money and a new one that appreciates your business and allows you to do whatever you want not sure the choice should be hard here finally a note about margin all accounts can have margin generally but that doesnt mean you should use it i thought all night about writing this because if you fucks come onto one of my platforms and do a ton of stupid shit and get me banned from being able to buysell common stocks ill be pissed but in the effort of giving us the little guy a chance i felt it better to put this here borrowing money to buy stocks is stupid and in the long run you will lose money either from depreciation of account value or interest or both if youre holding gme on margin right now for example you might be best opening a new account and not doing a transfer because you dont want your new brokerage to restrict your trading because you seem high risk obviously some of the bigger better brokerages may start making their new account process harder anyway if they see an influx of what they deem to be risky investors coming over but id suggest you be first in line before that happens if you want to be up and trading this week i have buried this part at the bottom because i wanted the message to be heard before any of my own thoughts were placed in here i personally am finding it a bit on the nose that so many people are claiming that theyre going to hold until valhalla and yet they arent willing to freeze their trading ability for a business day process for a transfer to happen that is suspect af to me but thats just me if people want recommendations of brokerages to consider new accounts with i offer some ideas vanguard trowe price merrill edge especially if you bank with bank of america this is going to be your best bet because money should transfer instantly fidelity tdameritradecharles schwab though i may have read theyre restricting buying so check that first to my knowledge all of these platforms allow you to sign up for a new account instantly online or very close to it if you do nothing over the weekend and nothing first thing monday morning to correct this robinhood situation that it seems many of you are in and believe me i feel were brothers in this and therefore im trying to help then i will remain baffled and ill be sad to see you guys continue to be squeezed i have been able to buy dips this past week that you guys werent and that sucks good luck gents you no longer have any reason to be dicked around by robinhood and i suggest you get on this asap because this week could get worse ampxb for whatever reason mods keep deleting my shit so i have no idea how long this will be here i think its because a mod accused me of pding on another sub and i called them out but i cant confirm that if you are that mod and you read this im still holding that position so please consider the disservice of removing this before you do disclosure again i dont work for any of those brokerages mentioned

l8ow40,GME,-51.27%,how wall street may try to take gme tendeis from retail investors and how retail investors can protect themselves,Discussion,96,0.92,cryptodgn,165,ok so before you incinerate me i want to make things clear i have been holding since $ level i sold part of my position as i want to buy a house and that money definitely helps at the end of the day we want money for these kind of things i am still holding shares though because i like the stock now that everything is clear i just want to highlight potential ways wall street may use to take away your tendies if you are a gme investor and how you can protect yourself this is my opinion based on what i observe and nothing else potential price supression by hedge funds thursday and friday volume purple circle was really low in contrast to previous days monday to wednesday when the squeeze started green circle this means two things everybody held the line short squeeze has not even started what happened on thursday and friday seems to be blatant market manipulation to supress the price without the participation of retail investors obviously i can not prove this but volume is the smoking gun there are also some other posts in wsb that show how short sellers are selling longs to cover shorts maybe that is why the rest of the market has been red the last two days ampxb gme hourly chart so hedge funds could try to keep the price supressed for weeks or months by restricting retail participation this is how they ban discourage people from buying and encourage selling how you can protect yourself if you want to invest consider buying the stock or if you prefer call options spread them between different maturities the worst thing that can happen is that you buy weeklies otm and they expire worthless this is how they drain your capital and outlast retail investors if your broker does not allow you to buy open an account into another broker mainstream media misinformation we have seen cnbc manipulating what is happening and trying to spread the narrative that retail investors dont know what to do they are trying to push the narrative that retail traders dont know what to do and it smells to me like wall street is going to ask to shut down forums like this one and limit access to leverage products such as options you can find a great interview with chamath where he literally destroy the cnbc reporter on youtube just type chamath gme amc and you will find it how you can protect yourself be careful with posting loss porn from gme options after thursday price manipulation where lots of people that bought atm and otm options were robbed by hedge funds while retail investors could not participate in the market lost money they may use these posts on tv and twist them like they lose money because they gamble and they do not know what they are doing therefore it is necessary some regulation in place to limit access to leverage products as they can not take care of themselves robinhood or other brokerage services potential bankruptcies i posted about this yesterday but inmediately deleted the post due to panic it caused it was not my intention sorry robinhood funds are covered by fdic which means your money is safe in the event of bankruptcy but what i am not so sure maybe someone can clarify is in the event of bankruptcy what would happen to your portfolio aparently robinhood liquidated some positions for different users without their consent you can find posts in wsb related to that so maybe they can liquidate your holdings at market price give you the money and thats all this is just pure speculation from mi side now if they do this while retail traders are not allowed to participate hedge funds could buy your shares at whatever price they want and cover their shorts given that citadel is their main client i would not rule out this possibility i know this is too much speculation but could be a potential scenario given what happened on thursday may have happened because the gme trade caused a systemic risk in the whole us financial markets due to leverage on hedge funds that went short people have also written other posts about this in wsb under this scenario robinhood would be sacrified short sellers would cover at the price they moreless want and any potential amount you have on your account not covered by robinhood would be covered by fdic aka the american tax payer sounds familiar maybe like again there is a video on youtube about this topic in the meet kevin channel seems the guy is quite popular in us how you protect yourself i dont know what you can do in this scenario just hold your shares because if you want to transfer them to another broker maybe they also liquidate your positions not sure about this if anyone can confirm please that would be great obviously once gme squeeze is over get out of robinhood if you want to buy gme you can do it from other brokers tldr if you invested in gme hold dont panic sell never nothing has changed the short squeeze has not even started be careful with weeklies this could last weeks or months better buy the stonk or spread across different maturities get out of

l9p1xu,GME,-51.27%,shkreli on gme,Discussion,377,0.75,martinshkreli,1097,gamestonk gamestop gme my thoughts are on reddit under my umartinshkreli amp subreddit rmartinshkreli those are authentic and discuss why gme is one of the most unprecedented events in market history here im going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on shortselling in general lets cover my own unique angle on the concept of a short squeeze most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by shortcovering i believe shortsqueezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker the image of pythonlike buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading many knew me as a shortselling specialist on wall street focused on binary events of biotech stocks i think ive seen it all i was once short more than of a companys shares outstanding i do not recommend this i bought of a company on the open market etc shortsellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs they get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting like longs they can double down if they wish the only difference is that of course short positions grow when stocks rise and they can rise infinitely while long positions fall asymptotically to zero but both get theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred more attractive as they move against the trader short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs typically tiny but sometimes massive they have to locate stock to short again usually easy but sometimes difficult both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise why despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock the ultimate fear of a shortseller is a buyin it is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice excluding optionsrelated activity a buyin occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the locate which is supposed to underlie the short sale the buyin order is typically violently disruptive a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market the sec published a list of stocks at risk of buyin the fail to deliver list my point is that a short squeeze can only practically affect the trader for two reasons the first is that the trader digs in doubles down and doesnt exit as his position grows thats bad trading and will eventually blow the trader up but if the stock is a good short that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger handsa better entry pricesmaller position whats more is the average investor cant tell if this is happening the second is the buyin i havent heard gme shorts being bought in but again how would you know other than the grapevine my point is most of the disruptive exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock new longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices speculating theyll increase further thats called momentum those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices but if there is a large short position in the stock a speculator may feel that those covering buying to get out shortsellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum thats sometimes the case but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers my feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out and typically in smaller size remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices in essence short squeezes become a selffulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to squeeze this sometimes phantom of a short seller and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason with some popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman or with a short boogeyman of any size speaking of which where is chanos and his slavish groupie carson block  speculative momentum can occur for any reason lets not forget that the trapping shorty strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock you usually dont want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs i recall writing a short report on a stock to watch it fall that day if you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks they are pretty awful the reason there is no arbitrage is the borrow rate but even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy and money into the stock than the short sellers white towel ever could a sledgehammer killed the fly now what alternatively are you the host or the parasite on populism i dont really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is an enemy concentrated big investments bets give rise to emotional behavior typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking its a lot better to be socratic with your opponent and understand what theyre thinking if your position were to be half the size it currently is would you be as emotionally interested try it youll lower your risk and feel better some of the behavior going on at wsb sounds more jihadist than speculative the idea that there are some investors who are good and others who are bad or that there is an establishment is bs everyone has the same goal i have a pile of money im trying to make it bigger fuck your pilei dont care about it anything other goal is contrived foolish and wont help you win you cant fight the rich by trying to become one of them dont you see the irony a related thought experiment what if this trade continued to work really well and another and another then some wsbers are billionaires arent they the new enemyestablishment who do you think hedge fund managers are theyre typically the antiestablishment things have changed a bit but the most successful hfms are actually the wsbers of the past these are guys who didnt fit in well at ibanks often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out tps reports when they started their firms people like soros icahn steinhardt robertson cohen griffin loeb who has posted anonymously on boards samberg even cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital often begging for investors the need for an enemy to sustain increasingly insane behavior it isnt uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat oppressive regimes used this technique in the past and the media uses it today retail investors dont have much power individually with your $k rh account you cant day trade or even qualify for margin its pitiful so its understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a player that you read about to be a part of something the problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a lifeagnostic but impotent jihadist blowing yourself up wont impress anyone and there is no afterlife here other than a minimum wage career and moms sofa gme and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the wall st machine dont worry about getting even with the rich thats jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy no one here hopefully wants to be a lemming those willing to die on this hill have to realize something wall street doesnt care about its speculators the new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them nothing changes when ltcm blew up or amaranth visium galleon or anyone else it is out with the old and in with the new so perhaps wsb can blow up hedge fund or maybe but so what eventually the tables will turn and it will blow up the leveraged fastmoney trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees directly or indirectly they only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills they know there will always be another speculator lined up ready to shove his money into the lotto machine there is no pride here there is no credit for being a good solider you either survive or you dont your job is to survive and thrive becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gamblers ruin enjoy the proof in measure theory with enough time anyone playing a game with lt success rate equal payouts will lose all their money get that number above add the kelly criterion to your trading strategy you might ask thats all well and good or well agree to disagree but mr shrek isnt this a good trading strategy ganging up on shorted stocks as long as youre not a lemmingjihadist willing to walk over the cliff whether or not you have a cause and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethicalmarket manipulation question i dont see anything wrong with it there are better ways to make money since youre asking stoking or worse participating in a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy once a stock is absurdly valued youre just hoping the selloff doesnt happen while youre holding it if you have enough lemmings or jihadists helping you thats a good thing they will hold your bagsomeone needs to  of course if youve found the next microsoft or apple no one needs to hold any bags but no company can increase its objective aka fair value quickly enough for this phenomenon situation absurdity to make it reasonable those things take years go slow and steady and this frenzied buyingshort squeeze phenomenon wont let value play a factor thats why wsb gme longs have shifted theses from well gamestop wasis cheap to the gaming cycle to ryan cohen will save us to jihad each member of the herd has its own financial parameters too some may have $ some $ or more some may be willing to lose their entire stake and even more on an outofthemoney or levered trade some are not some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former some are in one column at one price and another column at anothersome are switched from column to column by force todays lemmingsjihadists are tomorrows sellers when youre hanging off the mountain pay attention to the guy holding the rope loosely coordinated buying can certainly affect stocks heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to move a stock the irony here is when putting on a position the traders goal is typically not to move the stock with his actions i still think gme is wildly overvalued but that doesnt exactly mean im bearish one funny idea here is reflexivity gme stockholders may become serious gme customers and the companys fundamentals improve that way excluding some such miracle eventually gme stock will trade at lt again i still think it will trade at or more before that happens and that the decline process will take a long long time several years keep in mind anything can change gme can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock managements job is to create value for their shareholdersbut perhaps they will avoid pissing them off theres a strange loop finally the stock could be halted by the sec or completely banned by brokers dont overdo it

future for sustainable agriculture and cost reduction ok supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays which they should but sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle food production is a massive contributor to global co emissions see tldr soybean trade is bad for the environment soybean and corn is currently processed for animal feed but guess what you can create animal feed with minimal land space and water how the answer is insect protein ampxb insect protein animal feed industry archer daniels midland adm and innovafeed plan to begin building what will be the worlds largest insect protein facility in in the city of decatur in central illinois pros black soldier fly larvae eat noncompostable food waste bound for landfills produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources this will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal the massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water insects can be grown indoors requiring far less land and water not only does the farming of insects decrease co emissions in itself these insects eat and feed on waste this food processing decreases co emissions and reduces landfill waste cons insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed however innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost tldr adm is currently holding less market cap while trading at a lower pe and ps compared to ctva its biggest competitor adm provides x the annual dividend compared to ctva its biggest competitor aka boomers like dis stock too adm shows consistent although slow year over year growth current financials do not project adm to be a growth stock i believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio lower than market average however i believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term insect farming reduces required land and water you can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the worldor even the moon 🚀 🚀 insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models insect farming reduces co emissions and they feed for landfill waste you can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste and reducing co emissions positions i am only holding shares at the moment as we are seeing a current market pull back i will most likely enter leaps $c this allows time for the insect protein segment to develop who knows maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative 🚀 🚀

l9sh9e,GME,-51.27%,dddd why gme might 🚀🌝 next week and how it could trigger a financial crisis,DD,4722,0.96,ASoftEngStudent,1434,in todays edition of dddd datadriven dd well be going over over the details about what happened this week with gme the drama around robinhood and other brokers and take a close look at some data to determine whether or not gme and other various meme high si stocks such as amc bbby fizz lgnd and bb will continue 🚀🚀🚀in its short squeeze this week and how this all could lead to widespread stock market crash and financial crisis but first something to cover my ass for the sec investigators combing through this subreddit disclaimer this is not financial advice and a lot of the content below is my personal opinion and for entertainment purposes only in fact the numbers facts or explanations presented below could be wrong and be made up and with some satire thrown in dont buy random options because some person on the internet says so do your own research and come to your own conclusions on what you should do with your own money and how levered you want to be based on your personal risk tolerance what exactly happened at robinhood this week there has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified although reasonable rumors on why robinhood did this ill go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by robinhood pressure from the white house and sequoia according to a robinhood employee this statement has been refuted by sequoia i personally wouldnt believe the sequoia part since i dont really know what they would gain from it theyre a venture capital firm not a hedge fund and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks it could be possible that the white house or someone from the government did contact robinhood actually id be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going onduring this call they may have been afraid that gamestops short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and degrossing causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in and in march ill talk more about this later basically without robinhood shutting down gme from being bought its actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week and this was something the biden administration was trying to make sure didnt happen in the first month in office possible intervention from citadel securities this was a theory i personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people the most straightforward one being the fact that citadel the hedge fund dumped a few billion into melvin to bail it out a few days ago who were the very well known shorts of gme citadel the hedge fund is owned by citadel llc which happens to also run citadel securities a market maker if you dont know what this is go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my previous post about this citadel securities is effectively robinhoods sugar daddy directly being responsible for around of their revenue in through their payment for order flow ie selling your trades to citadel giving them the right of first refusal and potentially giving you a worse price this is how they get commission trades btw theoretically citadel the hedge fund and citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by citadel llc but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest theres also a possibility that citadel securities losing billions of dollars being short so many gme calls they write of all options contracts and probably not being perfectly gamma and especially vega hedged so when those two greeks skyrocketed on gme they probably lost tons of money there according to wsb hero chamath he didnt invest in robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users granted they already literally do this and do this type of shit the official reason clearing house limitations lets get to the official reason put out by robinhood which is that their clearing house in this case the depository trust amp clearing corp suddenly increased their collateral requirements on gme trades drastically apparently robinhood is running out of cash so they werent able to provide the cash collateral demanded by dtcc and hence werent able to trade through them lets dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work lets talk about what a clearing house is and how they work imagine bob wants to sell dylan a share of gme theres a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share which can take a few days to finalize this is called settlement however you dont want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons so thats where the clearing house comes in lets call this clearing house mary what mary does is facilitate clear this exchange and ensures both bob and dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles if one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange eg dylan goes bankrupt mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from bob instead if it turned out that bob was lying about actually owning a share and cant transfer it over to dylan in time failure to deliver mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead since gme suddenly became very volatile and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question at least on the sellers side dtcc decided or due to pressure from other sources to increase the collateral needed for buying gme to be more than x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading for some reason robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like fidelity and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform whats robinhood going to do about gme robinhoods decision to stop purchases of gme basically got hate from literally everyone to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way heres a list of things that happened as a result of robinhoods decision for fun ted cruz retweeted aoc saying he completely agreed with her protests at nyse and robinhood hq class action lawsuit someone paid to have an airplane fly around the bay area over robinhoods office saying “suck my nuts robinhood” angry robinhood employees were given doordash credits for some reason congressional investigation to robinhoods decision sec investigation to robinhoods decision clearly this decision has singlehandedly made robinhood the most hated company in the world right now its especially bad given the optics their mission is to literally “democratize finance” with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions this decision whether intentional or not has literally gone against everything about robinhoods image and mission and will end the company if not fixed soon all of this right as robinhood is planning to launch their ipo the people in charge of robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume gme trading so far weve seen them raise $b from investors and $m through lines of credit overnight although based on the fact that gme is still restricted that doesnt seem to be enough however in my personal opinion i think its likely that robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation and once they do they will likely reenable trading on gme if that happens which imo will probably be some time next week gme and all other highsi stocks will absolutely 🚀🌝 how gme almost caused and still can cause a stock market crash lets go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the gme short squeeze the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall in fact the stock market had the largest decline since october across all sectors on wednesday when gme amc and other highsi stocks surged with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after robinhood suspending purchases this was one of the biggest degrossing of hedge funds in history chamath wrote a great twitter thread about this so amazing that ill just copypaste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself gta childrens book explanation of whats happening gt gt if you are smart money you are allowed to take your $ and leverage it up to $ gt gt you can now buy $ of stock and if you promise to short companies you can short $ of stock as well gt gt in finance language this means that you are $ gross $ of longs $ of shorts but $ net $ of longs $ of shorts this makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero riskbut in reality your $ is exposed to $ of risk gt gt now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on reddit its called an ideas dinner gt gt you also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an sec rule you dont have to tell anyone about your shorts gt gt now the less cool people who werent invited to the ideas dinners start copying your longs based on your report gt gt you realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks you also buy options puts which has to be reported gt gt now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you gt gt but then an outsider notices that the math is way off gt gt apparently some of these shorts that you own represent more than of the entire stock of the company huh gt gt so he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys starts a massive short squeeze others see whats happening and they jump in gt gt now a massive short squeeze starts you have to cover your shorts asap but the banks also notice that you dont have enough credit to cover the $ they lent you and ask for more collateral you now also have to sell your long positions gt gt what happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down which stocks went up basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place hedge fund grossing degrossing in other words as stocks like gme go up the highlyleveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts most retail investors are limited to x leverage but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions they can be up to x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price ie beta neutral so theyre “safer” to get out of these short positions they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “net exposure” triggering a selloff in those stocks a very similar thing actually happened in march with riskparity causing hedge funds to similarly massively degross and literally everything from gld to even amzns stock price dropping as a result even though theoretically covid wouldve been good for both from a fundamental basis as we saw later on its very likely that if robinhood hadnt stopped purchases of gme many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to degross causing a widespread stock market crash potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the decadelong liquidity leveragefueled asset bubble weve been experiencing in fact this could still happen since it doesnt look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and are still heavily short gme with net shares shorts barely moving this week according to s partners furthermore despite seeing the largest degrossing of hedge funds since gross exposure aka leverage of hedge funds still remains close to recordhigh levels tldr in case your attention span was too short to read everything above robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume gme purchases when this happen gme 🚀🌝 much of the stock markets value is held by overleveraged hedge funds so if gme and other common shorts 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it edit as hedge funds reconsider their long short strategy triggering a financial crisis now just to be clear buying gme right now is joining a game of hot potato the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short gme that being said with short interest barely moving this week this day of reckoning doesnt look like itll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above its probably more likely for gme to reach $k next week than the probability that itll fall below $ or in other words i like these stocks edit appearently s partners just contradicted their tweet on friday and now indicate that shares short of gme have dipped below m shares still highly shorted compared to most other stocks fwiw edit getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this and my answer is that gme alone wouldnt cause a financial crisis but rather what gme represents which is disproving that hedge funds that a long short strategy ie taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long is unviable the word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a sixsigma event or one in a billion chance of happening which is obviously no longer true hedge funds seeing melvin go down will probably start reconsider their short books this on mass will cause a mass shortcovering and also selloff of their longs hedge funds levering up using cheap money has been the basis of the stock markets rise the past year how do you think money

l9n1o6,None,N/A,trading tips for stocks and options part i,DD,41,0.85,negovany,29,i though of sharing some trading tips and answers to questions ive seen multiple times on discord over the last two weeks if you are absolutely new to stocks and options you should start with likes of investopedia to learn basic mechanics and greeks this post will focus on a little less obvious things i sold options and they became in the money when will i get assigned technically you can get assigned at any moment since youve sold it but if there is any extrinsic value of an option contract if your option is trading higher than the difference between the strike price and the current market price of a stock it will almost never be exercised before expiry watch out for these two events though hostile takeovers and dividend trigger if the dividend payed is higher than extrinsic value well also watch out for drunk idiots who exercise by mistake its expiry day at what time will i get assigned most often option clearing corporation will trigger automatic assignment of any itm options unless other is configured by the client in his brokerage the default automatic exercises and assignments processing time is pm eastern time however the occ permits client manual exercise decisions for until est at my sold options have expired worthless am i good no as mentioned above – if the price in after hours moves and makes your options itm they can still be assigned until especially be cautious in the days of earnings or days when f are published — those can move asset prices after hours quite a bit can i buy or sell options beforeafter hours no generally you cant the exceptions are very select instruments also some brokers offer exclusive packages and allow you to trade options outside regular hours but you will be basically trading with the broker himself how options and stocks are taxed if i exercise or get assigned options premiums are added or subtracted tofrom the base price of the stock say you bought calls strike price for $ premium on the day of expiry the price of your stock has gone up to your calls are now worth $ but you still believe that the stock price can go even higher you would prefer to own and hold that stock you can sell those call contracts and be taxed for profits of $ per contract but if you exercise your contracts your base price will be $ per contract and your profit will be your future sale price minus $ works in a similar way with puts and short positions in options disclaimer this might not be accurate for all jurisdictions and accounts this is not an accounting advise please contact professionals why my options are losing value even though the underlying stock went in my direction up for calls down for puts options prices are more complex than simply tracking the performance of a stock again it is useful to learn the greeks but to start you should understand two most useful aspects time decay and implied volatility if you have short term expiring out of the money options their price will decline even if the price of a stock goes in your direction but not fast enough implied volatility can be described as market sentiment and expectancy of price changes the higher is the belief that the price will change – the more expensive are the options especially with low delta for example if you bought calls after days of insane volatility but then the next weeks it moved up for only or your calls will likely not gain but rather lose value because you bough them at the peak of iv and since the volatility seemingly settled down the market no longer expects huge moves and is no longer eager to pay big premium for your options there can be also socalled unusual activity thats basically large amounts of purchases of some particular options outstanding against the general flow those events can change premiums for a period of time too and often indicate a start of a new trend can i do a poor man covered call on a cash account poor man covered call is a strategy of selling otm calls but having a deep itm call as a hedge it imitates covered calls strategy some people assume that since this strategy caps your downside risk this will be allowed on a cash account this is false cash accounts allow no naked options selling even if your max loss is caped what is settled cash and free riding rule most trades have settling periods for stocks it is t the day you traded business days and for most options its the next day this means that if you sold something the cash is not immediately delivered to your account brokers will still allow you to buy with unsettled cash this is called free riding but if you sell anything you bought with unsettled cash — they will give you a days restriction for violation of free riding rule this is very uncomfortable this applies only to cash accounts if i added to a position under free riding rule can i still sell if im within limits of what i bought before no for example if you had shares for a long time but bought more shares under free riding even if you then sell only share before cash is settled you will still get a day restriction at least on most brokers that i know can i sell covered calls when i have $ settled cash on cash account not on all brokers some brokers will treat selling covered calls as if you are using formal margin and since you have $ settled cash your cash doesnt exceed your margin sounds moronic but thats how it works you might be caught in this situation if you are rolling covered calls on a cash account you buyback those contracts get bellow your settled cash and then cant sell new covered calls until next business day how to save on commissions if im not using a commissionfree broker some brokers allow you to configure your orders with numerous options first of all dont use their smart algorithms or any kinds of quirky ‘special sauces times out of you will get both worse execution and bigger commissions secondly if configurable always ask for an allornone orders this will ensure that your order will be much more likely filled from one source and on one exchange thus minimizing your commission finally there are exchanges that offer traders rebates for added liquidity for example nyse arca pse and bats offer rebates to customers for added liquidity in options trading yes you will get a cashback for your trades configure destination of your orders to select those exchanges note some brokers will provide those rebates to their users and some will just take it themselves note rebates are offered for adding liquidity for removing liquidity you will still get charged hope this helps feel free to write your questions if you have some and good luck with your

l9chbg,GME,-51.27%,diamond hands not enough gme price surge gt gamma squeeze gt moass,DD,903,0.96,BenjaminGunn,672,good morning fellow degens gme has already changed my life more than i could have imagined and i know thats true for many of you but im not selling yet i want to see this thing through so im diamond handing my remaining shares however i came to the realization that diamond hands may not be enough lets review where were at but lets do something to make it a bit more interesting for those aspects were not certain of lets assume the worst case for gme retail this is a helpful way to think through risks generally so why not apply it here lets go assuming worst case for retail all shorts are new shorts did melvin and shitron cover lets assume they werent lying when they say they closed their short positions but lets take that idea further and assume all existing shorts are new shorts remember were talking worst case shorts entered when the price was at recent highs so the pressure on them is not as extreme as previously thought borrow costs would have been high but hedgies would have planned for that this means new shorts who bought high are intending to hold until retail eventually folds theyre prepared for a longer game gamma squeeze sqouze there was no major benefit to closing above friday we could argue about naked calls but were assuming worst case here the gamma squeeze already occurred earlier in the week when the price jumped over forcing mms to delta hedge open call contracts by purchasing additional shares this did cause a price spike earlier in the week remember we touched at one point that was the gamma squeeze then robinhood threw cold water on the party i misunderstood gamma squeezes and posted some incorrect info in my earlier comments ouch sorry ive gone back and edited those for great info on why the gamma squeeze already sqouze check out ublueestees post whales are big for a reason i am suspicious of anyone who suddenly calls me a friend after my portfolio jumps in value arent you so lets assume that the whales who were hoovering up shares from the hedgies ladder attacks are not retails friend check out ujknks post in rinvesting i know i know which goes into great detail about how whales bought dips but those dips were still way above analysts evaluations of gme ie they still paid a lot like in the s id guess so we can assume whales share a nearterm interest with retail both want the share price to go up but after that who knows im sure whales wont want to hold any bags remember they got big by feeding on smaller fish what if worst possible future for retail heres how this could play out poorly for retail retail mania drives the stock price up higher but not too high whales unload their shares to retail at higher prices and exit brokers either further restrict trading or some other obstacle prevents retail from driving the share price higher shorts hold and out wait retail retail loses interest or a black swan event occurs there is no moass the share price falls and retail take massive losses game over what if gamma squeeze triggers moass going to the moon takes rocket fuel and thats where the gamma squeeze comes into play massive upwards momentum early in the week should trigger another gamma squeeze a gamma squeeze may force the shorts to have to cover and lead to the moass remember a gamma squeeze occurs when the price goes up quickly forcing mms to buy shares to delta hedge open call contracts this occurred last week when we passed which was the highest available strike the highest available strike this coming week i see a strike in tastytrade do we have to hit no idea maybe someone with more wrinkles can tell us i want to give credit where credit is due here upyrsmurfs posted some great dd on this to roptions because it looks like theyre banned atm from wsb anyways they make this same case with charts here why im bullish on the gamma squeeze next week its in the whales best interest to see the price goes up to so retail has professional rereinforcements we have several possible great men of history cohen musk chamath who may either buy shares or announce news that shoots things skyward leading to the gamma squeeze retail interest is insane billboards i love you guys that is incredible worldwide interest really beautiful stuff hats off to

sub knew there were massive tendies to be made not single person in this entire scenario expected it to play out like this lets take a step back and review the facts amidst the bot attacks fake news and overall noise coming from the powers at be gamestops long term prospects look good marketing $$$ and more $$$ fundamentals are what we care about as the business needs to go through a paradigm shift in its model thankfully it has we can all thank new daddy cohen for making this happen by investing in the long term strategy for revamping a business that was on its way out he involved himself on the board brought in his former chewy associates and is making bigly moves to start setting up their pivot gamestop would naturally start to increase as speculators saw serious financial backing from an independent investor with an alignment between management and shareholders starting to form obviously when board members and csuits are shareholders they have vested interest in the performance of the company if you go and read wikipedia on gme you will see that they did not have any shareholders in upper level management until which helped create the situation we are in if the people running the company do not care about the value of it they have no concern to prevent the value from being destroyed so yay management now gives a fuck we have our first ingredient aligned $$$ now on to the second ingredient big $$$ gamestop has to finance its operations for and as it went deep into the red the lack of free cash flow and poor sales prospects drilled their credit rating to emerging market status and set them up to fail if they could not find profits again which with shit management is to be expected with the new interest from stakeholders gme took off gaining market cap and opening up a new avenue of financing even if gme hit a modest market cap of lets say bb they would have been able to raise money without diluting the float by much but now with a market cap approaching bb its becoming absurdly easy for them to raise capital hell even raising a cool billion becomes viable now via a secondary offering gamestop has become a self fulfilling prophecy as of no amount of shorting can sustain a low value for the stock so they have a solid avenue to raise more cash which in turn means they can pay off their debt increase their credit rating and what do you know all of the sudden they can become profitable again third ingredient attention and faith self explanatory the whole hedge fund situation has brought more media attention to gamestop than any other form of marketing now literally everyone and their mother will know about gme forever and a lot of people who used to engage with the brand are now flocking back now combine that with the faith that new daddy cohen has inspired you have a recipe for massive tendies ampxb now when we combine aligned monetary interests with new financing capability huge investor confidence on management and brand awareness well fuck me thats one hell of a grand slam with these few ingredients gme can cook up so many tendies we already know they are working on making pc gaming more mainstream and with all the renewed interest they can definitely pivot to some more interesting revenue streams think the nintendo center in nyc for the heads who know gamestops could become these social venues where gamers meet up and play together or maybe hangout and have a beer adult gaming and entertainment is actually taking off with the millennials and i expected it to be a serious path forward for gamestop maybe not exactly like a video game bar but some form of live socialgaming experience is something that i think is highly likely they will integrate the financial institutions have their back against the wall nothing can save them other than a gov bailout its really a matter of closing the loss on the way down there is no fucking way on this planet that these shorters walk away from this in one piece i do not think they will become insolvent because you know wall street but there is no way they do not take heavy losses the sheer grit from new comers lurkers big names and ogs is unspeakable people have taken this scenario personally and people are just throwing money at this simply to say bears r fukt hedgies eat cock which is not something this hedge fuckers could have seen coming they have an innate arrogance that prevents them from considering such things they know how much money they control how to influence the right people and their all homies with the important people so why should they care about the little guy when they can bend us over and fuck us whenever they want well jokes on them cuz my wifes boyfriend already went to pound town and my ass can handle the pain and guess what so can everyone else in this game now people are just buying buying and then buying some more no matter the financial hurt the buy side pressure has not and will not degrademaybe when we hit a share since a lot of people might get priced out then but it is a losing battle for them as every retail buy takes another share off the market so they are in a pretty pickle the longer they wait us out the fewer shares they have to work with the higher the price the more they bleed the more they short the worse it gets basically the longer they wait the more fucked they are so hold because they will be trying everything we have seen this past week on us to get us to sell become distracted create fud prevent us from buying restrict options you name it ampxb all we need are these two points and you can start to see how there is literally no way out for these guys the challenge the real challenge that gives us our diamond hands is waiting yes patience as buffet has once said the stock market is a device to transfer money from the impatient to the patient we are the patient we are strong together we are the fucking players and the hedgies know it they are the impatient ones as each day they lose money and each day they have to work to remain afloat every single person on this sub does not need to do shit other than buy gme when you see it at a price you like and never sell until the shorts have bled all their capital ampxb tldr gamestop has all the ingredients to generate real long term value for their shareholders be patient the shorts have already lost its a matter of how much now be patient the hedgies have to work everyday to figure out how to unfuck themselves while we just has to scroll wsb and find confirmation bias dd like this one pretty simple be patient watch

l9ul1c,GME,-51.27%,gme next steps,Discussion,1179,0.91,sorengard123,569,ive gotten more than a few dms so i just want to offer my thoughts in a larger setting i apologize for wasting others time and space background mba w years including stints in investment banking equity research vc and corporate i know enough to be dangerous should i invest tomorrow i would invest with the understanding that youre playing a high riskhigh reward game vs the best on wall street ws who arent accustomed to losing hell you put a dent in one of the most high profile hfs on the street redditwsb wsb is beating ws at its own game and ws will not accept that the reason that i would still buy shares is because im perfectly comfortable waiting out the shorts who i believe didnt cover entirely based on some sketchy trading volumes and price action on thursday known as ladder attacks which is basically artificially lowering a securitys price by selling it back and forth between two parties note the wsj is reporting that melvin closed their positions at a loss of to the fund maybe they did though i dont trust melvin or the wsj regardless i have no doubt that other hfs are salivating at the short opportunity given where gme shares are currently trading the key is the somewhat unreliable short data which comes out next week as i mentioned in a previous post getting accurate short data is next to impossible it makes polling data look flawless by way of comparison it has gotten to the point that i dont believe anything i read because there is not only time lag but synthetic longs and ladder attacks all of which serve to obscure the data no firm wants it positions known so there is a strong incentive to obscurehide the data another reason why melvin publicly releasing its positions is just highly unusualodd i would also be aware that a lot of hfs are making bank off the gme volatility by selling options and taking long positions just look at rthetagang the group is making their entire investment decisions based solely on the option premium without any concern for the underlying narrative to the point where theyre short gme puts at the strike and they think wsb is full of retards to use an analogy im a lifelong giants fan who put a $ down on the giants beating the pats in the superbowl the pats went undefeated all season and the giants entered the playoffs as a wildcard the bookie even told me when i placed the bet that i was just throwing away my money i bet the money line ie no points and ending up winning $ the bookie just smiled at me when i handed him my ticket sometimes you just gotta trust your gut and stay loyal to your instincts no matter what others think its what separates the men from the boys tldr its a cliché but dont invest in gme what you cant afford to lose at this point youre going against some very powerful hedge funds ie the pats in that said wsb already scored a very impressive victory and is retarded enough to not realize how good their competition really is just like the giants in the super bowl how will the media portray the narrative the media have already started spreading the narrative that wsb is going to cause a financial collapse rather than the true culprits namely the hfs which leveraged up x to short of a companys shares outstanding setting the stage for an infinity squeeze which is the financial equivalent of a nuclear chain reaction i mention this because the greatest risk imho is government intervention to quell the markets when the hfs start unloading positions to meet margin calls and borrowing costs nobody will lose sleep over a few billionaires losing a few commas in their net worth but hitting ks pension funds and endowments is a different story the official narrative will involve large commercial banks which loaned melvin and other hfs billions to leveraged up with these banks are regulated by the sec and fdic because they hold commercial deposits when the narrative shifts from melvin and hfs to names you recognize eg jpm bofa citi rest assured the game is almost up my guess is were in the seventh or eighth inning of this game before its stopped when people ask me about wsb i first discuss the hfs who created the conditions and then secondly note that thankfully were dealing with a relatively small company in gme with a market cap of $bn so far compared to a company in the sampp which is the basis for index funds and portfolio construction in short wsb did everyone a favor by calling attention to such a disastrous scenario in as optimal circumstances as possible we should be very thankful wsb alerted the public to a systematic flaw in the financial system before a much greater meltdown occurred tldr the media are the pr firms for wall street they exist to promote a narrative and receive access and compensation in return they have no interest in reporting how the retail investor is being swindled in contrast wsb did everyone a favor by pointing out a very serious systematic flaw in as optimal fashion as possible this is the truth and the message that needs to be heard whats the next step finra releases short data next tuesday february th for the period ending this past friday january th roughly mn gme shares changed hands last week or x the total shares outstanding so im pretty sure the short interest si has fallen below however i expect it to still be well above given the typical hfs risk appetite by which i mean they expect the retail investors to run for the exits sending shares back to $ish levels i would love to know the borrowing costs for these firms because it basically tells you how long they can wait before such costs negatively impact their returns my guess is until march when they have to report q results to investors tldr short data will show a decrease in si which is not necessarily a bad thing but its important to note that the riskreward profile of the trade has moved how much good did this gme trade really do besides transfer a lot of wealth a heck of alot at a minimum wsb drew well needed scrutiny to the role of option clearings firms such as citadel and wolverine ie the shadow economy and their dual roles as market makers and hedge funds players and referees this screams conflict of interest a revolution doesnt happen overnight but this is another step forward in demonstrating how rigged the game is against the retail investor and guy in the main street our regulatory agencies exist to enforce transparency and fairness wsb has demonstrated that the derivatives market and particularly short selling lack both and have the capability to cause a financial panic and of course there is the unbelievable amount of charitable donations from wsb gains which prove who the real robinhood is sorry couldnt resist citadel alone handles more than of us equity flow the company is a monster and barely anyone knows it exists which is how they like it they tell wall street what the regulation is and they pay washington to enforce it former fed heads bernanke and yellen have received almost a million in combined comp for speeches and advisory services from citadel in short citadel makes goldman look like the united way and oh yeah of robinhoods revenue comes from citadel in return for order flow assume what you will tldr sunlight is the best disinfectant – justice brandeis for the questions below and messages as i tried to communicate in the writeup i would characterize the trade as more risky than a week ago when the si was above i have no doubt many shorts have since closed that said i suspect the si is still well above given where the stock is and typical hf risk appetite this is not a trade for your parents or grandparents there is serious risk here that the share price collapses based on who the counterparties are and the lower si that said i still like it and im in it imho it comes down to a game of chicken in the sense of who is willing to hold longer hfs have investors to report to in q vs wsb who have bills rent and life to deal with as my old coach would say who wants it more the market has returned per year for the past decade a good hf aims for x that you guys are banking returns on a trade lasting approximately a month against the best hfs on the street these returns are not normal or even within several standard deviations they are clearly

l9bwat,None,N/A,a note to hedge funds financial authorities and the media in anticipation of next week,Discussion,2775,0.98,everynameistaken998,624,hello fellow apes disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice or an encouragement to others to take certain positions i am fully retarded and had crayons for dinner last night also i wear a helmet all day long and i cant even cycle in anticipation of next week i need get something off my chest regarding the financial authorities brokers and the media we all know how wallstreet has ruined the economy over and over again with the crisis being the most recent one what was wallstreet doing when the economy collapsed and thousands lost their home and ended up in debt thats right celebrating with their buddies because they made billions they were literally laughing at the little man from their balconies while sipping champagne what consequences did they face thats right none now a bunch of retards on an internet forum found out about wallstreet making two mistakes of monumental proportions shorting more than of a stock grossly underestimating how stupid retail investors really arenow as a consequence $gme surged to unprecedented levels and it seems the finishline has not yet been reached consequently a few hedge fund managers are starting to get nervous because the red numbers are running up luckily for them they have billions and friends in high places that would not mind a share of those billions the result brokers shutting down retail investors whereas hedge funds could short and buy the stock freely some brokers actually may have had problems with clearing houses but all of you know which brokers did what the ultimate goal of this short ladder was to trick people into selling unsurprisingly they did not the aftermath of this showed that hedge funds and brokers are holding hands and probably clenching their buttholes too it also showed that the media is beyond willing to stick their neck out to protect the big boys the media have been portraying the hedge funds as the ones that really know what they are doing unlike those bubblehead retail investors simultaneously we were described as ‘an altright platform what we are a literal bunch of individual retards who just happen to like the same stock from time to time financial authorities are calling market manipulation by retail investors they are saying that hedge funds deserve the time to ‘recalibrate their positionsthey are saying they needed to halt trading to ‘save the financial system well let me tell you this if the survival of the financial system is so strongly related to the survival of a hedge fund it is your system that is wrongi dont know man but last time i placed a shitty trade i did not have the opportunity to call my billionaire buddies to ask them to halt the market so i can ‘recalibrate my positions if you make a dumb financial decision you take the l and thats that the rules should not be changed after the game began and more importantly the rules should be the same for everyone for years people have wondered how those people on wallstreet make so much money they have been shouting the answer from the rooftops for a long time ‘be greedywallstreet deemed itself absolutely unbeatable but the retail investors listened and they are hungrythe arrogance and blatant market manipulation backfired and exploded right in their faces and to be honest they deserve it ive seen dozens of articles about this not being the real value but in the end a stock is worth whatever people are willing to pay for it and we like this stock and lets not forget guys since when do hedge funds give a damn about fundamentals thanks to wallstreet we have seen unimaginable surges and crashes throughout the years but now they are suddenly crying over fundamentals and about how they just want to make a living get of out of here pleasedue to the market manipulation last week it became obvious that this is not even about fundamentals the free market is free until the poor start taking from the rich extreme surges are apparently only market manipulation if hedge funds are not in on it politicians celebrities and working class people alike expressed their indignation about what happened hedge funds crossed a line here and the anger towards them is not misplaced this no longer is about fundamentals okay it kind of is because the short squeeze thesis is legit but this is now also about morality hey wallstreet and financial authorities by trying to manipulate the market and squeeze some measly dollars out of retail investors you have turned yourselves into the biggest antagonists on the planet so to any financial authorities or hedgie spies reading this i am holding my $gme if

l9qvf9,GME,-51.27%,unpopular $gme dd,DD,144,0.59,RlCKJAMESBlTCH,588,before i start let me just say that i am all about the $gme train and hope it is a way trip to uranus for all those holding with diamond hands i have been around wsb for years under this username and my other less anonymous one check my other posts to confirm i am not hedgie agent scum now to the unpopular part a word of caution i see a lot of dd around here analyzing the short interest the $gme public float and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock yes we like the stock however all of this dd fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $gme if you look at $gmes articles of incorporation this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and among other things states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue you will see that $gme is authorized to issue up to shares currently it looks like there are about shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with so theoretically the board of directors of $gme could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today is the board going to do that your guess is as good as mine on one hand the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground but on the other hand the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company if they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $ price level they have to legally consider it this could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale so could they easily issue more shares the answer is yes in december the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement this allows them to essentially at any time and very quickly register a followon public equity sale you can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market because diamond hands of course now a couple of good things even if the board wanted to do this it seems very risky for all concerned i think we all know that after the squeeze is done hitting whatever price it is going to hit $ $ $ eventually the price is going to come back to land could be a week a month a year who knows when that happens selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance note that i have argued the price today of $gme is totally supported for economic reasons is going to invite lawsuits galore so perhaps the board which is risk averse by nature doesnt want to make a move without letting things settle out time will tell also all of this free press has to be a boon for business and i have to believe that the board sees what happened with robinhood aka robbin gainz where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there thus this is another reason that the $gme board probably wont issue more shares to screw over the wsb investors many of whom are their target market all that said i want to see the $gme rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you monkes🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖 also need to give some love to the rest of the $bang stocks $bb $amc and $nok 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 lets hope the $gme board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly 💎👋🚀🌖 edit tldr i predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖 but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely edit i will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the nyse does have a “ rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a nyselisted company from issuing more than of its outstanding so that is a real constrain as well there are some exceptions to this but no one wants to read more about this,2021-01-31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9qvf9/unpopular_gme_dd/,1612069200
l9qx8p,None,N/A,why wsb is now running the entire equity market pt investment professional here,Discussion,89,0.56,vegaseller,547,i wrote an article months ago about why wsb was running the equity markets i explained how the rise of passive investing ala mike greens thesis was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive and this is leading to a war between retail wsb and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep the passive money it explains the massive runup of teslanio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles i wont go into this in depth those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up mike green from logica i wont go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops for those who want to read more i would recommend chris cole of artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast end game with grant william this time around i will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding gme i will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided and i will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next gme misconceptions the two misconceptions on gme have to do with manipulation of gme shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole the problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work the prevention of gme buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with citadel or melvin or any market makers the fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldnt care less and robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds the real reason is that some of these smaller brokers dont have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses which was raised on them over the past few days this is why the largest guys like fidelity didnt have that issues which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines such as robinhood drawing down $ billion from banks once they bring on enough liquidity they will enable them again but until then we still live in a t settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs the implementation was retarded but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly the other misconception has to do with wsb finding in infinite money wormhole trust me i was there when a relative value fund i interned at in basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented i was there when the italian banks were on the verge of collapse sitting on my x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a year old when draghi announced ltro and blew my portfolio up there are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played one such way is that management can simply issues new shares likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up another way is that the sec could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt misplaced hatred of hedge funds if one looks around the financial landscape today hedge funds are actually a dying breed the young put about of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about of their capital to work in active funds as a result since about active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying even though they played almost no role during the gfc if anything many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers the problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value long undervalued short overvalued in a world less and less flow cares about value the narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs this could not be further from the truth the value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company a company could trade at value but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet it will keep going hiring people and expanding the truth is that these evil hedge funds were managing long short books they were owning things like facebook apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturncrisis what happens next the effects of the gme short squeeze should not be underestimated not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $ billion thats peanuts in financial markets terms the full ramification is actually on the long side from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies i would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions it could very well be that this derisking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market and as we have seen during the march selloff without active managers who have cash on their books who are the buyer of last resort but instead passive flow who actually tend to go bidless in a market crash we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before if the market does crash congress may blame this on reckless speculators and ban option trading for those under certain incomenetworth thresholds just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for despite being innocent retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money the lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end i have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading vix calls and some weekly atm spx puts congraduations you autists have beaten hedge funds who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks in the first major battle but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools gamma squeeze i would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection maybe youll gamma squeeze the market into a correction and

lafj3l,AMC,-28.96%,in theaters near you an indepth amc analysis response to cnbc dd 🚀🚀🌕,DD,228,0.97,FiveDollarPutLong,60,thank you mods for letting this through please click here for the pdf version if you would like to download the dd credit research compiled by igwydstockbros to get things started im not a financial advisor im not a bot and this one goes out to you chamath tldr amc is the global leader in a $ billion dollar industry thats been beaten senseless to the ground with so much room to run after pioneering deals with streaming services buying out their competition and upgrading their facilities worldwide short interest is highly inappropriate for its true fundamental value — $ a share 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$amc to $🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$amc to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 im questioning whether theywsb are actually doing the research when it comes to things like gamestop and amc clueless cnbc dude i fuckin miss movies and when i say movies i mean the whole damn experience i wanna buy my $ popcorn pour an ungodly amount of butter and jalapenos on that shit and munch in a recliner seat watching in laser k quality i like this company i like this stock for the past few days ive been scouring google for news articles and company data ive also been trying to find some detailed dd in here but theyve all been pretty limpdick when it came to amc and most of the news articles ive read were surfacelevel at best with a grim outlook based on firstglance analysis guess these analysts are just too damn lazy to dig deep because when we dive into these issues we can easily see that the theater giant may not be in as bad a situation as the mediaanalysts are claiming in fact i believe that amc is absolutely misunderstood overlooked and undervalued here is why i am more confident than ever that $amc will not only reach $ but is in the perfect setup to see aths and well above i ugly start beautiful setup chances are if you are currently holding a significant position in $amc then most likely youve already read up on the company and its current standing in the cinema industry youve probably read about how the corporation has nearly $ billion dollars worth of debt with many of its locations still closed as the pandemic remains a global issue you may have realized that new movies havent been coming out but more than that youre seeing that movies are just being released on streaming platforms anyway you might be concerned for amc or even the industry as a whole all of these concerns are very valid and based on real uncertainty but lets break down each of these points and see if theyre as bad as analysts claim ii a discussion on debt media outlets keep honing in on this debt like its an ugly scar of the corporation but what we need to focus on is why that debt came to be how the money was spent and how this debt was a strategic play in order to cement amc into the new era of cinemastreaming we can categorize the money used into four parts new equipment and amenities lease payments maintenance costs utilities wages etc expansion buying out the competition pay close attention to the last category because this one is important over the past five years amc has been acquiring smaller theater companies like odeon after buying out these companies amc then had to suit its new locations with the standard luxury amenities amc is known for this makes for a significant bulk of their debt totaling over $ billion in just acquisitions this was the investment that helped solidify amcs spot as the worlds largest cinema chain on the topic of maintenance costs amc managed to raise enough money to get through with ongoing news of vaccines we can hope their efficacy leads to a speedy reopening near midlate but when the economy does reopen—and amc is back at full operation—what will it look like iii the future of amc theres an elephant here right in this very room yes streaming and cinema have had some serious beef in the past in fact some cinema chains are having tensions with streaming to this day but what has amc done in regards to streaming they were the first to settle deals in order to partner up and take part in streaming revenue yup you read that right amc is both having their cake and eating it too why would motion picture companies do this why not just end the cinema industry to put simply analysts are deeply underestimating the value of the cinema experience just as i mentioned in the intro i miss the cinemas but i am definitely not alone but lets not talk about me and the hypothetical people instead lets talk about research studies in a year study done in korea researchers found that shortening the window of cinema exclusivity and releasing movies on streaming early did not have a significant effect on ticket sales and though this is a limited study done outside of the us remember that amc is a global corporation and these results have a hopeful outlook for the future relationship of cinemastreaming for amc worldwide but wait you still havent mentioned what streaming gets out of this its not what streaming gets out of this but rather what these motion picture companies maintain in keeping a healthy relationship with cinemas during the peak heat of the movie theaterstreaming feud amc halted the showing of trolls and vowed to never show a universal pictures film in its theaters again if they were to continue releasing their films on streaming platforms without a proper cinemaexclusivity window but today we can see that the tensions have fallen and both motion picture companies and amc have found a way to mutually benefit each other now besides streaming amc has been investing in luxury amenities as seen by their chairs k laser projectors merv air filtration and ultrasurround sound speakers with so many locations and so many amenities they are offering full theater rentals with high demand during the pandemic amc has further cultivated their centuryold movie experience into modern times and this pandemic didnt just change their amenities they had to learn how to cut costs and have more efficient operations in order to survive this only spells good news for when they emerge with better operations more money to spend and higher valuations so that begs the question how high can the companys share price go realistically iv valuation first lets look at the movie theater industry as a whole in comparison to a few other popular entertainment industries movie theater us market size $ billion casinos us market size $ billion amusement parks us market size $ billion music label music production us market size $ billion music publishing us market size $ billion in the world of entertainment cinema is a very lucrative business and again who is the largest movie theater chain in the world yup amc clueless cnbc dude mentioned that we retail traders dont trade with a fundamental reason but is there a fundamental reason in shorting a $ billion dollar industry global leader down to its grave does amc deserve to die i surely dont think so now i wont touch upon squeezes in this since im sure many of you folk have already readheard enough about them but i will leave this quick intuitive article about it and yes these shorts can and will be squoze once we have faith in our upper valuations and investorswe begin buying again and buy again we will as many users flee limpdick robinhood and join one of the real brokerages their positionsfunds will be settled and ready to trade come next week where do you think these angry rh refugees will be putting their investments thats right exactly into the positions that rh stopped them from buying last week which includes $amc if you were part of the rh user base and your plays were affected by the blatant market manipulation its not only not too late but i believe it is an opportune time to buy how high can it go then when will i know its too late to take a position so when we talk about valuation many people fear the uncertainty of a stock rising far past its current value well i think chamath palihapitiya said it best everybody that bought that stock is also underwriting how they want to own it in our current priceaction environment its not too ridiculous to see how we are forming the foundations for amc to continue rising beyond aths we are already hitting nearly $ on the day and rallying while enduring heavy trade restrictions whos to say that this passion cannot continue now im no expert and cant tell you how high this can go but i am personally eyeing $ as a target with so many current factors at play including hype short covers and itm options having to be exercised this is actually the best entrance to manifest its ath valuation and chart some never before seen territory in its price action its like the manifest destiny of stock valuation in fact we may never see this opportunity for amc again if we dont act now and solidify its value upward at the end of the day prices are what the buyerssellers settle upon so we can pioneer that value if we damn well please this is what a free market is all about will there be people that disagree with this sure will people continue to short amc as it goes up absolutely do i think that amc being shorted and rising is fair really see section iii but institutions are selling off like silver lake liquidating their m shares yes then the next day $amc dipped to $ and has since recovered… with amc $m less in debt we all know who is shorting amc and i am sick of these hedge funds who think they alone can decide whether or not a company is worth a damn v conclusion resurgence we are at the cusp of amcs resurgence because most of us have been kept from participating in social activities we can better understand that the public is yearning for a sense of normalcy sure weve gone pretty far with just watching movies on our tvs or computers through the pandemic but that doesnt scratch the itch for many folk what youre investing into when you invest in amc is the entire experience in tandem with its new streaming deals and having been beaten so low—while still holding such great fundamental prospects— its share price is ready to blow up in the future when “the deep squeeze” is turned into a movie well be a part of history and youre going to want to see it on the big screen position $k in calls and shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$amc to $🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀$amc to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀,2021-02-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lafj3l/in_theaters_near_you_an_indepth_amc_analysis/,1612155600

lahcsd,GME,-51.27%,💎🙌comprehensive gme diamond hand strategy guide💎🙌,DD,967,0.98,NHNE,185,“if you know the enemy and know yourself you need not fear the result of a hundred battles if you know yourself but not the enemy for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat if you know neither the enemy nor yourself you will succumb in every battle” sun tzu were in a war with the hedge funds and with wallstreet and basically the root of corruption in america with our gme short squeeze proxy war and if you autists want to win this war you need to know the enemy and know yourselffirstly education is key so if youre new you definitely need to go learn at least what a short squeeze is and a short ladder attack is what the enemy is doing price manipulation with short ladder attacks they use high frequency trading to make the price artificially lower can be seen with sizeable price movements that have tiny amounts of volume there are several reasons why they are doing this scare off paper hand bitches they prey on people who jumped on gme without even knowing what a short squeeze is they see price fall they paper hands and they get out make it cheaper for them to cover their more costly short positions price manipulation will fail ultimately because while they are able to drive prices lower with their short attacks when they eventually have to cover their short positions and buy they will again drive prices up due to purchases of almost none existing stock cuz we be holding sending prices up as high as before they shorted or even higher all the while hedge funds will continue to eat fees and interest on their short positions making this cycle not doable indefinitely media manipulation most if not all american main stream media is clearly serving corporate and wallstreet interests simply by the false narratives they are reporting are not to be trusted and if seen can dishearten and shake the will of those who dont have diamond hands best to avoid if you are a paper handed bitch some examples of false narratives are reddit is made up of altrights or idiots or gamblers etc gt were not idiots because were the ones who were able to grab wallstreet by the nutsack were retards and autists who love the stock and the company that is all reddit is moving on to silver gt silver cannot be squeezed with a market cap of more than $ trillion there is no way for retail investors to be able to make a dent in that the only possible short squeeze play is gme because its a small cap company with a market cap of only $ million as of july so it is definitely doable for a bunch of retards on wsb to affect the price of a small cap company stock literally all the posts on reddit promoting slvr are from bot accounts that have sus creation dates and karma and post counts plus citadel owns a giant amount of silver so silver prices going up higher is gonna benefit them and give them more fuel to fight this gme war youre shooting yourself int eh foot if you buy slvr xxx is the next gme gt this is also a false narrative nothing can be the next gme because nothing is shorted as much as gme which is still over shorted gme is a once in a lifetime opportunity gain for us and loss for them shorts have covered their position gt another false narrative short interest is still over at and there are multiple wsb posts that explain this another metric that correlates to short interest is cost of borrowing for opening short positions which would increase if it is harder to find shares to short breaking the law some if not all of the things posted above are pretty much border line illegal but there has been clear signs of breaking the law and market manipulation ie freeze buying of select stocks and only allow for selling they can spin it however they want but as far as i know it has been unprecedented for a majority of brokerages to simultaneously alter the way a stock can be traded with cash and if the situation is desparate enough theyll break the law again and again if it ends up costing them less than to just let the price get to $ expect them to fight dirty until the bitter end social media manipulation hedge funds now employ bots to spread doubt and misinformation in order to weaken your hands some places they target is wsb itself other stock trading subreddits facebook and on sites apps like webull and yahoo finance dont believe in random comments always believe in wsb posts with huge amounts of likes top posts are vetted by the mil users here by mods too to make sure theyre factual their current strategy wallstreet calls us dumb money because they think we are unsophisticated and just chase after a quick buck and we have short attention spans theyll try and continue to manipulate the price so that the stock will trade sideways or continuous short ladder attacks trying to scare paper hands into selling and bore diamond hands into selling as well they will also try to tempt us with other next gme type plays and may even artificially raise prices of a stock or two ie silver to try and get people to hop off the gme rocket theyll use media to continue to push narratives that the gme short squeeze is over short positions are covered and redditors have moved onto something else if this fails then they may simulate a squeeze by suddenly letting the price go up to $ or $ then unleash a short ladder attack unlike which we have ever seen to simulate the sell off so idiot retards will be scared into thinking they missed the top so they will all sell but if people just look at the volume theyll know its all a ruse ampxb ampxb what were doing our advantage and why the enemy cant win this is a movement this has become more than a few people of a subreddit trying to make a quickbuck off of a short squeeze this has become a movement that represents the struggle between the corruption of wallstreet and the vs the the common people news agencies from all over the globe are reporting on this and have their eyes on this we have ape brothers and sisters all over the world buying and holding this stock together we even have a few outspoken whales on our side as well as well as politicians from both sides of the spectrum speaking out for our side as well we have billboards being bought all over the country airplanes flying banners about gme a global movement will crush any hedge fund we are holding and were continuing to buy we are getting smarter tougher and slowly but surely paper hands are turning into diamond hands we managed to hold during the short attack to $ on thursday and that was when they froze our ability to buy across many brokerages they will never have another chance to do this again now with everyone watching the volume trading these days is getting smaller and smaller any price decrease is strictly from short ladder attacks and not us selling due to tiny tiny volumes also we are continuing to buy calls on gme to increase upward pressure no one here has stopped buying nuclear bomb still undetonated short squeeze still coming it hasnt happened yet we know this because the volume of shares bought is not nearly enough to show the shorts have bought enough to be covered enemy loses money everyday we dont it costs the hedge funds billions to continue to fight this war of attrition becauase they continue to eat insanely high fees and interest on their short positions because the cost of borrowing remains high because the short interest are remaining high melvin down over just this month alone you think they can hold on much longer and keep eating fees we dont have to pay anything for holding our stocks we can literally just hold and not have a short squeeze and just from the cost of borrowing alone the hedge funds will run out of money so thats why there will come a time where its cheaper for them to cover their positions rather than just keep on bleeding until they die out i dont think they can hold out for another month of trading sideways with no progress i believe in feb we will see some major action it could even start as early as tomorrow because thats the last day shorts have to cover their puts that expired were not breaking the laws they are recent rumor mills are saying that there are a lot of counterfit stocks circulating and the hedge funds and clearing houses are all in on it and once they need to start to find shares to buy to cover their short positions things are going to explode in a way that is unprecedented basically by taking advantage of a situation wallstreet has set up insane short

train past $k easily x their bananas those apes who bought in at $ will only get to x their bananas at the end of the month the autistic apes will also understand that this is not a day thing but the events leading up to the squeeze can take weeks but the autistic ape will ask itself is it willing to wait a few weeks to at least x their bananas most apes will answer yes but the ape knows if they buy it they should be prepared to see red in their banana tracker for a month but those red number are just fake numbers generated by hft short ladder attacks and not due to other apes actually

lai275,GME,-51.27%,technical analysis of gme and reality check,DD,179,0.64,spike142,330,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and nor am i writing this as financial advice this is simply my perspective as an options trader on the current situation with gme many of you will hate my perspective you will call me a insert rainbow bear emoji i am write these on word so yeah you will tell me to fuck off and drag me through the mud but all i am trying to do here is provide this growing community with some original and well thought out due diligence and research on a very popular invesment that many of you have sunk your life savings into and sometimes you have to go against the grain to help a community see a different perspective i also want to say that i am extremely proud of this sub this sub has done something that no other sub has done on reddit or any social media platform for that matter however this is a sub that was built on due diligence degenerate trading and crazy gains and loss porn and to see this sub shine a light on a clearly broken system is something to be truly proud of however the time may have come to realize that we were indeed robbed of the moass which it absolutely tears me up inside to say so this was going to be by far one of the greater events to occur in the history of assets management and trading i for one was loaded to the hilt in call options and ready to rumble just like many of you and like many of you i made multiples of my salary within the first few weeks of january it is life changing money there is an old saying in the industry and within trading that you “ride the trade until it doesnt make sense anymore” and i am afraid to that we could either be fast approaching this or have even passed it at this point so below you will find my technical analysis on gme and why i feel like it might continue its downward trend this is of course is subject to change and just my observations i hope this helps some with a better understanding of what is going on and how to read the charts technical analysis my technical analysis approach i am an intermediate term momentum trader this simply means that i am trying to trade for the next days the tools i use are the following · rsi measures the strength of the movement or the strength of the momentum · macd this is trendfollowing momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two moving averages of a securitys price and helps you understand the momentum of a stock · volume speaks for itself · mvwap amp sma helps identify intermediate term trend and takes into consideration by comparing to shorterterm trend mvwap pink line sma teal line i usually use a mix of the amp minute chart paired with the hour to identify patterns within the market chart a below you will find the minute chart that spreads over the past five days of trading each data point represents a minute segment of trading the black shaded areas represent the trading session and the grey shaded area represent premarket and afterhours trading ampxb chart a minute intervals tuesday of charta shows extremely bullish pattern being built late tuesday afternoon and continued into the afterhours this was the culmination of papa elon and camath chipping in their two cents on twitter along with a clear series of purchases by institutional buyers this very well could have been melvin and the early shorts covering their positions additionally we can see that the vwap and sma are diverging further apart bulllish the macd is showing the same as well with the histogram showing no signs of slowing down as well bullish and despite an onslaught of short attacks and put ladders during trading on wednesday we still managed to end the day “green” however we can see that the volume drove itself right off a cliff and we all know what happened there after ever since the security price has shown an increased amount of volatility and the bid ask spread continues to widen throughout every trading session clearly the market makers are not doing their job in creating a market for the stock andor there is blatant fuckery going on behind the scenes either way it does spell bad news for the underlying security furthermore we can see that during the thursday trading session that three bearish events occur the mvwap and sma begin to diverge macd plummets with a bearish signal line crossover and the rsi plummets to sold territory as well to further support my hypothesis i have included the hour chart as well ampxb chart b hour trading intervals as we can see above the same sort of patterns that developed in the short term are now present in the long term hour chart only this time we can see how the patterns are drawn out over a longer period hour intervals and thus it may give us a better sense of where we might be heading at this time we can see that the mvwap and sma have tapered out and are possibly at the beginning stages of divergence that the rsi has neared “oversold” territory anything below is considered oversold and finally the longer term macd is showing that the momentum is being carried to the downside as i said earlier “you ride the trade until it doesnt make sense anymore” and based off my research i can no longer say that it makes sense to be positioned for the upside which is why on friday i started to trim most of my positions in gme it simply made no more sense to me to remain on the bullish side of this security today i trimmed the remaining bits and will be walking away from gme at this time i hope i am wrong i hope this stock can reverse and we can go back to the fucking moon i would be more than happy to dump a bunch of money to help build another gamma ramp but right now from my point of view that is not where we are again these are just my observations and i know a lot of you will find this offensive but if you are going to trade or invest you have to remove your emotions from the picture be a fucking robot for those

laecn0,GME,-51.27%,gme the game theory scenario,DD,362,0.93,Mistilled,191,fellow diamond hands first and foremost i have shares of gme which i first bought around $ as i learned about the short squeeze thesis i know i will get a ton of hate for this but in full transparency i will hold these until the price dips below my reservation price of $ at which point i will likely dump to at least get my cost basis back i am hopeful that this wont happen anytime soon though i think whats going on right now is a complicated game theory problem i am still thinking through this so would very much appreciate any input from anyone that i may have missed actors the shorts which include the melvins the citadels and the robinhoods the melvins represent all the hedge funds that are short the stock viking d maple lane etc the citadels represent the market makers that have to take on a net short position to ensure liquidity and volume in the stock as the price rides up and the robinhoods represent the brokerages that have to post up increasing amounts of collateral to clearinghouses as they are ultimately responsible for losses in major downward movements in the stock eg if someone buys gme at $ on margin they in theory should be called when the stock dips to $ but in the case of a couple trading days ago we saw it go from $ to $ very quickly making it difficult to liquidate the position on time and resulting in substantial losses for robinhood the longs which include institutions and retailers institutions are all the good guy funds like blackrock maverick vanguard etc that are long the stock the retailers are us i think we all understand the situation in that shorts are in a world of hurt if short interest truly is and costs of borrowing skyrocket there really is nothing shorts can do here they will get squeezed and we will get our tendies if we just all hold that being said the difficult thing here is the lack of communication and transparency that works against us id bet my left nut that citadel is on the phone with melvin whos on the phone with maple lane whos on the phone with lone pine coordinating every move ensuring no one triggers the short squeeze theyve got more weapons in their arsenal as institutions to run things like ladder attacks which we all saw these past few days being on the long side however is a little more challenging we need to have mutual trust across not just us as retailers which i think we have but also with the long funds for which there is no open line of communication theres a chance that they could cash out their position for a solid gain with a willing short at a set price in an otc deal that would not affect the stock price but would dramatically reduce the short interest and leave us holding the bag at the end of the day this is a very real risk that we need to have in the back of our minds the other wrinkle to this however is that if a true infinite squeeze were to be achieved all the short funds would go under robinhood would absolutely go under and theres a great chance citadel would go under as well while thatll bring us tremendous amounts of joy it would not bring blackrock the same joy as their other holdings would surely come down quite dramatically i think the long funds have to understand this dynamic and theyre clearly willing to play poker they understand that theres still squeeze to be squoze before reaching that catastrophic scenario outlined earlier but as soon as its in their best interest to sell before short funds and citadel go under theyll get out my takeaway from all this is that there is still room to run here which is why im still in but diamond hands from all of us are needed and we need to proceed cautiously its an uphill battle to climb given our limited ability to buy stocks on certain brokerages and the shorts having an arsenal of weapons to use including the media but if we have coordination amongst us an unspoken coordination with long funds and diamond hands we should be able to rake in some tendies very open to suggestions questions other theories,2021-02-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/laecn0/gme_the_game_theory_scenario/,1612155600

lahib2,None,N/A,twinkies for tendies long thesis on hostess brands twnk owner of twinkies,DD,75,0.71,POTUS-JebKush,97,tldr hostess brands twnk has high short interest more than amc or bb setting the stage for a short squeeze additional upside from a gamma squeeze is extremely memeable and has a fundamentally sound business with strong cash flows and organic growth trading at a reasonable valuation not intended to distract from holding the line on gme this is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade twinkies to the moon intro sup guys so i know a bunch of us are now looking for the next big opportunity to pile into unfortunately we probably wont see a squeeze of gmes magnitude for awhile since that kind of short interest is insanely rare but i think we might have found an opportunity that is pretty low hanging fruit and is significantly better relative value than the other names people are piling into it has what the finance community call “asymmetric upside” more upside potential than downside risk for the reasons ill describe below so whats the target hostess brands nasdaq twnk you probably know them as the company that makes twinkies but they also make cupcakes dingdongs hohos donettes and zingers cant make this up…now theyre going to make us some tendies™ as well for some historical context the company was privateequity owned for awhile and then went public via a spac in before spacs were as cool as they are today the previous owners have fully sold out now so the entire shares outstanding are pretty much public float today and theres no more downward pressure on the stock price from their share sales the company also has warrants from the spac effectively longdated call options that trade under twnkw they trade as half warrants so need two warrants to form one share and are itm at $ per one full share and expire in november so whats the thesis we think theres an opportunity to wring out the short sellers in this name and potentially even further upside from a gamma squeeze if we can get enough call option volume from a fundamental standpoint the business is extremely stable as it was a pretty ideal candidate for an lbo and trades at a slight discount to its peers technical thesis high short interest squeeze opportunity – roughly short interest today higher than amc which is last reported at see end of post for reference and bb at this seems low in comparison to gme but again this company has no structural problems that were aware of cant really say the same for movie theaters or mallbased retailers right now and has actually been performing pretty well also anything above short interest is considered pretty high in the normal world this level of short interest on a solid business smells like opportunity to squeeze out a couple of greedy hedge funds limited liquidity and trading volume will make it difficult for shorts to cover – average month daily trading volume of mm shares roughly of the float it would take about days for the shorts to fully cover if they were to buy up all the average daily trading volume current $bn market cap is also in the perfect sweet spot for the wsb pool of capital especially since many of us have our tendies tied up in gme right now if youre looking for a bit of tendie diversification this is the name the potential for a gamma squeeze is all further upside – theres actually been option activity picking up on this company on friday nasdaq reported that call options for mm of underlying shares traded hands on twnk this is with limited mention of twnk online thus far based on my keyword search through reddit see this report most of those options were sold otm at the $ strike price things are moving quick here and we might not be the only ones that have sniffed out this opportunity in order to create the biggest upside buying the highest strike call option is ideal as the price moves closer to itm on those options the market makers will have to buy more shares to hedge the iv is still really low on this name fundamental thesis snacking continues to be king large market resilient growing of us adults snack daily and the average american snacks xx per day the snacking category generates $bn in annual sales and is expected to continue growing midsingledigits driven by the need for convenience as consumers at least precovid are busier than ever lots of room for multiple winners in the industry of which i think hostess will continue to be one strong organic growth story organic sales have grown per year on average over the last number of years hostess brands is growing – and likely gaining share strong brand value and nostalgia factor with millennials some of you might be old enough to remember this but during when the company filed for bankruptcy due to the heavy debt burden from its buyout consumers freaked out that the company would discontinue production of their beloved twinkies triggering a mad scramble to buy up all available supply of twinkies at the peak twinkies sold on ebay for $ see article here the acquisition of voortman cookies in rides the healthy snack trend voortman sells crème wafers and sugar free cookies new product categories for hostess and markets as having no artificial colors no artificial flavors no highfructose corn syrup and no transfat playing the “betterforyou” snack trend voortman is one of the fastest growing independent sweet snacking brands of scale in north america and should be able to accelerate growth by leveraging hostess existing distribution footprint covid reopening should drive a bounceback in convenience store traffic which is the companys primary sales channel and may also increase demand as consumers become busy again and thus snack more management plans to keep growing within the convenience store channel which is a growing endmarket and should rebound as the world reopens as consumers get back to their busy precovid lives they may also go back to snacking more out of convenience potential risks changing consumer preferences especially to healthy the recent acquisition of voortman cookies in allows hostess to further capitalize on the healthy trend pretty high leverage for a public company they have roughly $mm of net debt or x leverage on adj ebitda adj ebitda is a proxy for cash flow this is pretty high leverage for a public company but quite low in private equity land leverage increased to x in the beginning of after the acquisition of voortman cookies up from x before the acquisition but has steadily declined to x today as adj ebitda has grown given their cash flow profile would not be surprised to see them continue to deleverage customer concentration the companys largest customer is walmart which was of sales top ten customers accounted for of sales in some risk with customer concentration but hostess brands is such a wellknown and entrenched brand that i dont think retail stores will do anything irrational rebound of covid risk that covid cases rise again possibly hurting traffic and sales through retail stores increasing costs or causing supply chain disruptions on the flip side the snack category seems to have held steady from consumers staying at home and snacking more appendix twnk q investor presentation q investor presentation november twnk acquisition of voortman cookies investor presentation acquisition of voortman cookies december reference for twnk short interest yahoo finance reference for amc short interest of s partners tweet and amc short interest calculation disclaimer i own a position in the stock twnk warrants twnkw august $ call options twnkc and august $ call options twnkc disclaimer this is not financial advice and is purely written for entertainment purposes please conduct your own diligence past performance is not indicative of future results conclusion if youre looking for a little tendie diversification or finding the next oversold stock look no further this stacks up as a much better opportunity than amc or bb given the higher short interest and more stable business fundamentals also we can also potentially create even more upside with a gamma squeeze if we are able to buy more call options at the high strike prices again this is not intended to distract from holding the line on gme this is purely a tangential opportunity that felt like way too obvious of a trade and hopefully does not require much capital bringing this to your attention now before it starts to trade away from us or before the hedge funds exit their shorts more

lagzcz,GME,-51.27%,whats happening to gme,DD,345,0.95,officialwillyum,191,credit to uthatpossible whats happened the past few days the anatomy of a short ladder attack published courtesy of citizens for securities reform at abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers with help from their friends at the dtc and major clearinghouses potential target companies are identified analyzed and prioritized the attack is planned to its most minute detail the plan consists of taking a large short position then crushing the stock price and if possible putting the company into bankruptcy bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they dont pay taxes on the illgotten gain when it is time to drive the stock price down a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers the playbook is very similar from attack to attack and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well typical tactics include the following flooding the offer side of the board ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply offer and demand bid for the shares find equilibrium this equation happens every day for every stock traded on days when more people want to buy than want to sell the price goes up and conversely when shares offered for sale exceed the demand the price goes down the shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares they will do what has been called a short down ladder it works as follows short a will sell a counterfeit share at $ short b will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position short b will then offer a short counterfeit share at $ short a will hit that offer or short b will come down and hit short as $ bid short a buys the share for $ covering his open $ short and booking a $ profit by repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral if there happens to be significant long buying then the shorts draw from their reserve of strategic failstodeliver and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit company news days are frequently attack days since the news will mask the extraordinary high volume it doesnt matter whether it is good news or bad news flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares an offshore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access the traders performance was tallied and based upon the number of shares moved and the other success parameters the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily at the end of each day the traders went to an atm and drew out their bribe instant gratification global links corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a companys stock price global links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry by early their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent at that point an investor robert simpson purchased of global links issued and outstanding shares he immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the sec disclosing he owned all of the companys stock his total investment was $ the share price was $ the day after he acquired all of the companys shares the volume on the overthecounter market was million shares the following day saw million shares change hands all without simpson trading a single share it is possible that the sec has been conducting a secret investigation but that would be difficult without the companys involvement it is more likely the sec has not done anything about this fraud massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume this is called crashing the stock and a successful crash is a oneday drop of twentypercent or a thirtyfive percent drop in a week in order to make the crash stick or make it more effective it is done concurrently with all or most of the following media assault the shorts in order to realize their profit must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at these shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation panic is induced with assistance from the financial media the shorts have friendly reporters with the dow jones news agency the wall street journal barrons the new york times gannett publications usa today and the arizona republic cnbc and others the common thread a number of the friendly reporters worked for the streetcom an internet advisory service that short hedgefund managers david rocker and jim cramer owned this alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted libelous innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company as it was being crashed one of the more outrageous stories was a frontpage story in usa today during a short crash of tasers stock price in june the story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that tasers electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair proof positive that tasers did indeed kill innocent people to reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the tasers amperage by a factor of one million times this mistake was made despite a detailed technical briefing by taser to seven usa today editors two weeks prior to the story the explanation due to a mathematical error appeared three days later after the damage was done to the stock price jim cramer in a videotaped interview with the streetcom best described the media function when shorting the hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful because the truth is so against your view so the hedge funds create a new truth that is development of the fiction you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders a short down ladder that pushes the price down then we go to the press you have a vicious cycle down its a pretty good game this interview which is more like a confession was never supposed to get on the air however it somehow ended up on youtube cramer and the streetcom have made repeated efforts with some success to get it taken off of youtube analyst reports some alleged independent analysts were actually paid by the shorts to write slanted negative ratings reports the reports which were represented as being independent were ghost written by the shorts and disseminated to coincide with a short attack there is congressional testimony in the matter of gradiant analytic and rocker partners that expands upon this these libelous reports would then become a story in the aforementioned friendly media all were designed to panic small investors into selling their stock into the manipulation planting moles in target companies the shorts plant moles inside target companies the moles can be as high as directors or as low as janitors they steal confidential information which is fed to the shorts who may feed it to the friendly media the information may not be true may be out of context or the stolen documents may be altered things that are supposed to be confidential like sec preliminary inquiries end up as frontpage news with the shortfriendly media frivolous sec investigations the shorts leak tips to the sec about corporate malfeasance by the target company the sec which can take months processing freedom of information act requests swoops in as the supposed confidential inquiry is leaked to the short media the plethora of corporate rules means the sec may ultimately find minor transgressions or there may be no findings occasionally they do uncover an enron but the initial leak can be counted on to drive the stock price down by twentyfive percent the announcement of no or little findings comes months later but by then the damage that has been done to the stock price is irreversible the san francisco office of the sec appears to be particularly close to the short community class action lawsuits based upon leaked stories of sec investigations or other media exposes a handful of law firms immediately file classaction shareholder suits milberg weiss before they were disbanded as a result of a justice department investigation could be counted on to file a classaction suit against a company that was under short attack allegations of accounting improprieties that were made in the complaint would be reported as being the truth by the short friendly media again causing panic among small investors interfering with target companys customers financings etc if the shorts became aware of clients customers or financings that the target company was working on they would call and tell lies or otherwise attempt to persuade the customer to abandon the transaction allegedly the shorts have gone so far as to bribe public officials to dissuade them from using a companys product pulling margin from long customers the clearinghouses and broker dealers who finance margin accounts will suddenly pull all long margin availability citing very transparent reasons for the abrupt change in lending policy this causes a flood of margin selling which further drives the stock price down and gets the shorts the cheap long shares that they need to cover click here for more on pulling margin paid bashers the shorts will hire paid bashers who invade the message boards of the company the bashers disguise themselves as legitimate investors and try to persuade or panic small investors into selling into the manipulation click here for confessions of a paid stock basher this is not every trick the shorts use when they are crashing the stock almost every victim company experiences most or all of these tactics how pervasive is this at any given point in time more than emerging companies are under attack as described above this is not to be confused with the daytoday shorting that occurs in virtually every stock which is purportedly about thirty percent of the daily volume the success rate for short attacks is over ninety percenta success being defined as putting the company into bankruptcy or driving the stock price to pennies it is estimated that small companies have been put out of business by the shorts admittedly not every small company deserves to succeed but they do deserve a level playing field the secrecy that surrounds the shorts the prime brokers the dtc and the regulatory agencies makes it impossible to accurately estimate how much money has been stolen from the investing public by these predators but the total is measured in billions of dollars the problem is also international in scope,2021-02-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lagzcz/whats_happening_to_gme/,1612155600

lahtvs,None,N/A,volume based ta,Discussion,116,0.96,mightyduck19,83,this is a quick post to show my drawings that i did with whats left of my edible crayons the main thing i want to key in on here is how volume weighted price levels effect market psychology and momentum im not really trying to make price predictions just trying to give some basic education to the noobs the yellow moving average in this first chart is vwap volume weighted average price for those that dont know vwap basically takes the average price over some period of time and then normalizes it by how much volume occurred at various levels over that same period of time vwap is interesting because it helps understand who is in the drivers seat w regards to momentum ie if price is above vwap then majority of bulls are itm and feeling good but if price is below vwap then longs are in the red and shorts are itm as you can see price broke above vwap in the premarket on the th and then shit got wild then price broke below vwap on the th and we still havent recovered back above it at this point vwap is going to act as a sort of resistance and the reason why makes sense when you consider the psychology of market participants if you imagine vwap representing the level where the most amount of buying has happened then you can imagine that as we retrace back up to vwap traders that have been in the red are suddenly coming back to break even as they get back to break even some people might decide to cut their losses and sell this is why we often see large moves followed by a touch back to vwap and then resumption back in the same direction as the original move hard to see on this chart but this happened at am on ok now were going to look a slightly more fancy vwap in the chart below i added in an anchored vwap which i anchored to the top of the premarket move on the morning of the th this is basically representing the obvious that since that point around $ most buyers are underwater intuitively it makes sense that it is above the normal vwap because the normal vwap is accounting for buying that happened at lower prices before the spike up to $ ok personally i find this final chart most interesting and imo it suggests that we might revisit the $ range this is called volume profile and its basically just showing the volume of buying that occurred at different price levels i decided to have it calculate this starting from the market open on the th things really got crazy after that through current admittedly starting it here was a little arbitrary but still informative anyway as you can see the majority of the volume that has traded since then happened at $ then there was a secondary spike of volume around $ and a tertiary spike around $ these levels will also act as sticky points moving forward for the same reason that vwap willpsychology consider the current situation price is above the primary volume level but were clearly looking pretty weak and dropping back down if you were a buyer at $ you would still be itm but you would maybe start to question the strengthoutlook of this as you slowly watch your gains disappearmaybe you would even start to sell a bit while you still have profits to selli think a lot of people would something else to notice about this chart notice how there is a complete lack of volume between and i would expect price to move very quickly through this range as there isnt much prior action here given that were already in the middle of this range after hours i would expect we hit tomorrow or tonight and then maybe even closer to tomorrow or the next as that will act as strong support tldr we wont see upward momentum pickup until we break above some of these key volume weighted levels the reason is due to the psychology of market participants and the fact that most people are currently underwater and wanting to cut losses when price starts to get closer back to their cost basis the most important thing to consider this same psychology applies to large funds they are so fucking deep underwater at the moment and when they start to get back to their cost basis they will take the opportunity to cover in other words the dip was expectedhold strong and the covering will start ampxb hold strong retards this isnt financial advice and im not trying to influence anybodies decisions in any capacity these ideas are my own and you need to assess riskopportunity for yourself ampxb it shouldnt be a surprise to anybody that read this that we are now bouncing around at the level where this volume block is this is going to act as major supportresistance imo it is imperative that we stay above this if we bounce from here anything is fair game,2021-02-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lahtvs/volume_based_ta/,1612155600

lanf94,GME,-51.27%,$gme is a time bomb and its highlighting a severe vulnerability in the financial system,DD,17995,0.97,forzan,1758,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice i barely understand how the stock market works professionally im a network security researcher my job is to find and explain vulnerabilities in other complicated systems that my smooth brain barely understands guess what you fucking idiot you arent allowed to collapse the entire financial market in less than a week using a phone app it takes more time there are likely several million new synthetic longs of $gme diluting the market that were created on they were created by a market maker or possibly several market makers to stop the beginning of a short squeeze that would have bankrupted hedge funds if a margin call hit them which ultimately could have financially impacted those market makers once liability for the shares was transferred these shares werent borrowed from anyone theyre imaginary pure fiction a promise only a handful of entities can make the reason they did this was to buy time to save their own asses the reason they were allowed to do this is because regulations let them the creators of those shares have days to deliver until then they arent paying interest there isnt a public record of their creation the closest insight we have to the number of synthetic longs in existence for $gme are the failuretodeliver numbers and $gme is a major outlier in that field a fucking terrifying outlier we arent bleeding out a hedge fund by holding melvin very likely is out of their position after losing half of their fund there arent new shorts replacing the old instead a buffer of imaginary stock was created by a market maker to flatten the curve when a massive number of shorts had to cover once retail buyers started rushing in thats why you arent seeing short interest increase even though there arent any short shares left to borrow these assholes are praying that in the next month retail buyers get scared bored or distracted theyre spreading fud attacking with short ladders hoping you watch the short interest drop and think its over theyre counting on you to sell your $gme at a bargain rate so you can pay rent because they think youre just fucking retail scum betting on a shit company and theyve been playing this game longer than youve been alive theyre also counting on you to obsess over things you can measure that they can hide they want you to set rules and limits on when youre going to run away simultaneous to the creation of these synthetic longs dtcc increased collateral requirements on to purchase $gme to this led smaller brokers like robinhood to restrict trading depressing the price conveniently making it less expensive for market makers to recover their synthetic longs the people that pushed this collateral increase knew exactly what would happen because its their job to know what the impact will be when they make changes like this dtcc openly stated they increased collateral requirements for $gme to reduce risk to their organization dtcc recognized financial liability in this squeeze could eventually reach clearinghouses if the market makers went bankrupt they know exactly what the failuretodeliver numbers mean for this security its possible that dtcc created new collateral requirements in coordination with the flood of synthetic longs explicitly to make it easier to recover those shares it is also possible these actions were taken without any coordination with market makers because dtcc knows it could have dampened and stretched out a squeeze through this act alone their strategy is to stretch out a short squeeze into a long high they can recover from if retail shares are sold over time since retail cant buy them back and the people working at dtcc likely rationalized this was the right thing to do to prevent a systemic failure that could have impacted the entire stock market because preventing systemic failures is the only reason organizations like dtcc exist meanwhile robinhood the smallest player in the game honestly dtccs buttboy in this scheme is going to be grilled by congress over this shit did you think we were the only ones that saw a black swan event coming when we bought shares the root problem is there are several players in the market capable of creating new shares without paying interest capable of restricting trading and they all face severe financial liabilities if a squeeze happens they want to turn the squeeze into a slow burn so the damage doesnt hit them if we continue to hold a squeeze could happen sometime around or after feb th or another market maker could create even more synthetic longs to dilute the market passing the hot potato this could make their problem even worse once those shares are bought and held this could continue for an extremely long period of time until a financial regulator steps in and forces them to buy the shares theyve sold tldr wsb is being made into a fall guy for the collapse of the market due to the creation of a massive number of preexisting synthetic longs that were bought and held to fix it market makers decided to make more but their cure is also a poison they cant stop taking strategy hold your positions buy at any price you can afford to hold forever and hope that retail owns more shares than the total number that exist for $gme contact the sec and ask them to investigate and to halt trading of $gme time is on your side if the clock ticks down the deadlines for market makers

lag1d3,GME,-51.27%,why $gme short interest appears to have fallen when in reality it has not,DD,14951,0.98,Semmel_Baecker,2194,ok girls i have an explanation why short interest is reported to have fallen when in fact it has not its not data faking its hedge funds hedging their shorts with calls and puts let me explain gary black is a guy to follow not always follow his advice or take everything for granted but he gives a good insight into how hedge funds think gary has the opinion that short sellers have hedged their short position by buying atm calls and selling atm puts that match the share count of its short ok so lets run through this scenario before expiration the fund doesnt do anything he has to pay the daily fee of the short interest on his shares and he loses value on his call as well as gains value on his put because he sold it this can draw out the short squeeze by month at expiration if the share price is above purchase price he can exercise the call return the shares and the put expires worthless so he keeps the premium if the share price goes down the call expires worthless but he buys shares with the put and returns these shares to close his short position in scenario the short interest stays the same as nothing happens but i can totally see the statistics to reduce the reported short position because it is fully hedged in scenario the call seller has to find the shares on the market in scenario its the same but this time the put buyer has to find the shares in all scenarios the short interest stays the same but the reported short interest goes down because its shoved under the rug of the options traders which means the statistics might be correct but the true short interest is still the same as before the shorts are not off the hook no investment advice you monkeys we have the shorts by the balls until they turn blue and fall off position $gme at $ and holding,2021-02-01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lag1d3/why_gme_short_interest_appears_to_have_fallen/,1612155600

lagusb,None,N/A,emotional involvement has never been this high please understand the risk involved,Discussion,111,0.65,[deleted],147,taken from rinvesting full credit to op umastercookswag wanted to post it here because i love this subreddit and i think some of yall need to read this ampxb first of all i cant wait to be berated in the comments im gonna be blunt i have seen a whole lot of dumb shit over the last week a lot more than normal and compounding all of that is an unprecedented amount of legitimate emotional involvement here so let me get started by saying outright that people getting emotionally involved with trading stocks always lose short long whatever it doesnt matter if youre a year old throwing in your life savings or bill fucking ackman not being able to admit he was wrong with herbalife letting your emotions be a major factor in trading is a fantastic way to lose money and a whole lot of you are really emotionally involved with this gme amc whatever to the point i am not making a buysellholdwhatever recommendation i have no special insight in to whats happening with gme or whatever else what i can tell you is that it is for sure not worth $ so lets dispel one quick thing this is not david vs goliath it also isnt the little man vs hedge funds or wsb vs big finance it might have started out that way but if you only read one thing read this gtmany of the big retail brokerages including robinhood route a lot of their customer orders to citadel securities so it ends up seeing a large percentage of retail trades in us stocks it can see if retail traders are mostly buying or mostly selling or mostly pretty balanced you might expect—i certainly expected—to see that retail traders were buying more than they were selling this week the stock seemed to be rocketing up on frenzied retail sentiment and the posters on wallstreetbets were all claiming that they would never sell and keep buying until it hit $ gt gtbut heres what citadel securities retail flow looked like in gamestop this week gt gtgraphic here gt gtretail investors were net buyers on monday but net sellers for the rest of the week through yesterday and all in all quite balanced about of retail orders that citadel securities saw were to buy and were to sell gt gtwhat do you make of that one reading would be “retail investors on reddit might have started the gamestop rally but theyre not piling into this stock now and the price action this week is coming from professionals” or as one twitter user put it “past the retail ignition the rocket ship was mostly intrafast money warfare” so just to be clear about this there is massive institutional money on both sides of this trade and retail is a toddler sitting at the world series of poker understand that melvin does not need to cover in the way a retail trader needs to cover you and everyone else have no idea what melvins position looks like and they can reorganize and exit a position before you ever knew it happened you dont know how hedged they are you dont know what their collateral looks like and you dont know if theyve covered and restructured a short at last weeks prices you simply dont know you only know whats been presented in the news which is almost certainly bullshit this thing could come to an end as fast as it started and you wont know what happened for weeks you might go take a shit at pm today and come back to gme trading at $ because ken griffin got on cnbc and announced they restructured their short at an average price of $ and were happy to sit on it make no mistake youll get kicked in the nuts and have your ball taken away faster than you can comprehend emotions the problem with this whole strike back at wall street narrative is that lots of you are getting really worked up over this trade losing money sucks but losing money and feeling like you got shit on by the big guy is going to hurt this isnt a moral crusade to them its billion dollars so if youre out here putting money and emotions on the line that you cant afford to lose there wont be a happy ending want to fight the good fight against wall street write your congressman tweet aoc or ted cruz get you a fucking picket sign and go wave it around on the streeet but dropping money on gme that you need in life aint gonna change anything except your net worth tldr know and understand who is playing this game and that they have access to tools leverage and markets that you do not youre playing le chiffre at casino royale right now you might think youre james bond but theres a good chance that youre just the fat dude in the corner short squeezes end fast as fast as they started if youre new to trading then understand buying gme at this price can mean all of your money will evaporate before you had time to make a tiktock about it get your emotions out of play here this whole nonsense political narrative is only going to cause you to make trading mistakes cant handle that then maybe its not a good idea to sit at this table lastly if you really just cant get yourself out of the whole fight the hedge funds nonsense at least understand that youre spending money that you likely wont get back if thats worth it to you then have at it but dont fool yourself in to thinking

lajjs2,GME,-51.27%,almost of all retail $gme orders were to buy fidelity dont buy into the fud 🚀,DD,3877,0.99,2001kraft,231,final edit there are critical support levels of retail buying points those are which was unbroken at the tie of writing and am today feb has clearly broken as people closed off positions at breakeven and the flood gates down burst open another sell off between amp am coincided with another sell wall at i think well make it all the way to before itll make sense to start buying long again you saw what happened at the same will likely happen at but i dont know where the exact floor is the data has been showing since the s that retail isnt holding the data presented as the cornerstone and namesake of this dd is no longer relevant the ratio of volume of shares per sell order relative to buy order appears to be higher than the ratio of buy orders to sell orders in other words there may be a distribution of raw orders but the sells are so much more packed that it breaks the ratio anyway the situation changed and as more data came to light i now know i was wrong i used to be a hodler until the situation changed i lost out on a lot of profit by holding through waning evidence at the s s and s and only pulled at —i was able to secure a little bit of profit to make this obsession a bit more worthwhile at time of writing the price is even with bullish conviction this was still a directionally correct move as i can now buy double as much as i had before that being said i think were in for more downside and i will not be buying back until we hit the bottom wherever that may be im still longterm bullish on the company transformation and will reenter a moderately sized position after the volatility settles down heres the original dd so you can see how i had brought up good data but was directionally incorrect in my sprinkled analysis of it learn from this like i did and youll be more successful in the future furthermore i will not stop writing dds because i think the data here is sound and makes sense what was wrong was the analysis which can happen to anyone with this many unknown variables future dd will take confirmation bias into account and will have higher probability of being on the money todays most traded retail assets on fidelity were $amc amp $gme and you know what people did they bought a metric fuckton of shares contrary to what some of the reddit daily thread sentiment which may or may not be botinfested hell at this point amp news outlets claim retail has seemingly not lost any interest in the stock and possibly prevented it from diving further obligatory disclaimer mods for the love of god please let this through it took a lot to write and i know for a fact it hasnt been discussed sufficiently didnt get a dedicated post yet also im a 🦍 and am not financial advisor and this isnt financial advice this is a synthesis of public available information with autistic analysis like sprinkles on a birthday cupcake disclaimer i am extremely long $gme 🚀🌙 update my stop loss got triggered and i am no longer long $gme until data changes the information here has not changed but the impact and its magnitude may have with that out of the way i present to you exhibit a order distribution of all $gme orders on fidelity today on were to buy the asset rather than sell it each order can have however many shares thats just fidelity if youre able to check the order distribution on other brokers like vanguard or schwab please post it below and ill update this post with your info usually this information is displayed on top traded stocks or on the stock page itself under some tab theres more webull is showing a distribution on the entire order book total outflow sells was quoted at and total inflow at while this may seem useless at first consider this the share price lost today but the order book is split not just of the outflow accounted for the collapse in share price exhibit b volume todays volume was half of the daily average half of the daily average and while the price movement may seem scary at first trending down on low volume is actually a bullish sign courtesy of uweedcomet after a strongvolume upward move if the market moves sideways in conjunction with lower volume for several days in a row it is a bullish sign indicating that all overhanging selling pressure has been relieved and any buying could spark a strong price rise in other words flat or even declining on low volume often precedes 🚀 🚀 🌝 literally any form of significant buying can move the price by a very high magnitude theres also been studies done on this phenomena and correlation was established between sideways or negative movement on low volume and a subsequent increase in price feel free to research this on your own accord and post your findings below for all of us autists to read exhibit c why retail buying may return soon im not a financial advisor and even less so nostradamus i dont know when well be able to take advantage of this sideways movement to our benefit what i do know is that that time is approaching considering two major events transition from robinhood amp other affected brokers to mainstream solutions• this was likely started en masse on thursday before rh transfer restrictions kicked in it takes market days to transfer an account to another broker and about the same for just slushing cash around that means a solid chunk of trades will be able to buy into the market beginning tomorrow and throughout the remaining week• many are also in the process of opening up new accounts these were probably started en masse on friday when transfer restrictions prevented people from taking the plunge a solid chunk of brokers need settlement time for instant deposits the instant deposits are capped meaning whale accounts arent able to kick in yet regular deposits takes business days to clear beginning tomorrow well start seeing larger retail accounts com online and regain their impact on price delta robinhood bottleneck may or may not disappear this week robinhood just raised another $ billion on top of their previous round which is more than enough to clear dtcs collateral requirements according to their own statements as of late this was the primary reason why robinhood restricted asset purchases in the first place if youre willing to trust them on that it means that we shall see a resurgence in volume from remaining robinhood users in the coming days conclusions putting together we get a potential recipe for another green eow retail sentiment being positive can translate into higher volume once logistical bottlenecks are cleared and resume assripping activities however it is by no means guaranteed and only the tippy top of the world know exactly what these mfs might pull off in the coming days get yourselves ready for either a positive or negative scenario this week beginning of next gme to moon another edit welcome to the end of the post im proud of you for making it this far in literacy class i want to respond to all of your comments and questions but automod deletes all but a couple of them ill answer them as soon as they show up update ok automod deleted a bunch of negative feedback which is wrong also some faqs that got blocked the questions were valid so heres the best i could do –retail made no dent so what to expect now i dont know what to expect what i do know is that retail made no dent because of the bottlenecks mentioned in exhibit c above –should i buy now or what i want you to make your own conclusion based on available evidence not seek confirmation bias i dont want to be liable for your money and neither does anyone else –smart money is leaving and youll be left holding the bag i have yet to see credible evidence in either the trading volume sec reports or formal announcements from any major institutional shareholder of gamestop that indicates theyre leaving if you have this information please relay it to me dont use comments youll get blocked by bot blackrock had to adjust due to internal requirements afaik correct me if im wrong update this post shows that more instutitional shares flowed out than in but more funds bought in than exited make of that what you will –amc i have no data on amc you should do your own research and make a thread like this –when selling then i have an emergency exit plan like everyone else should i dont have the financial capability to let gme go to ill keep a small position postexit just in case make an exit plan that aligns with what loss or gain you can stomach dont invest more than youre willing to lose nothing on this sub is financial advice you dont have to sell if you can lose everything im probably liquidating my

lapovy,GME,-29.62%,gme short squeeze what comes next,Discussion,923,0.97,exccc,259,things looked bad today and truthfully im surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day at one point last week the stock plummeted to $ and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded it dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed now lets talk about that day why did it go down that is easy insane trading restrictions especially on rh where the majority shareholders place trades but whats interesting to examine iswhy did it go back up my thesis is this was in fact melvin covering retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed melvin is not the only short in the game in fact many new short positions were opened some intentionally others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold some people were selling calls with an $ strike price others upwards of $ many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $ were now stuck holding the bag with a $ strike price on friday one of two things can happen to these people t they will have two business days to cover their losses if able if unable they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover this logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week so what happened today well loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here the extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesnt add up instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress now why would they do this this is a very interesting question if shorts have covered and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down shift attention to silver and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims normally i am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situationsbut this one only has one answer they havent covered if they were covered and out of this then all this other manipulation exists for no reason another question to consider if shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business again this has but one answer there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze the final thing to consider if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock its price should go upright well all of wsb and many retail investors are still adding on this dip now tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor if the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished itm on friday so all contracts that were sold to expire with a strike price of $ or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow technically t is actually so they might extend into wednesday a gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts i would laugh at $ price target but truthfullyi would now call that a minimum despite what today looked like price decrease low volume bullish now there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control if the stock keeps getting purchased and held then regardless of squeeze mechanics the price will rise with the squeeze $ is a fair and minimum assumption if we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further which at that point will have no merit then gme will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int wont be immediately squeezed its interesting to consider a pt when the squeeze is complete tldr if shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left why is trading still restricted what are they are afraid will happen with millions of people still buying more then this price has no reason to go downyet it is that is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade a ladder attack that cant be interfered with is a perfect attack volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering,2021-02-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lapovy/gme_short_squeeze_what_comes_next/,1612242000

laxp6m,GME,-29.62%,some thoughts on silver gme and game changing events with dragons and stuff,DD,5,0.53,Nov-81,25,disclaimer i am not a financial advisor and this is not financial advice i barely understand how the stock market works professionally im a computational researcher my job is to simulate complex systems that my smooth brain barely understands okay fellow retards loooong time lurker and europoor autist so excuse my spelling lets brake some things down silver its a real well played scheme on this you have to remember there is a dragon in the east where people have a historically deep bonding to silver and the dragon looooves to take a gamble so number one priority for melvin and hedge fund friends is to distract the dragon from gme with shiny silver imagine hfs did not throatfuck gme on thursday and the dragon banged into the marked heavy this uprising of the dragon is exactly what this autist observed by comments on wsb late wednesday early thursday if hfs didnt screw the market exactly this moment and pulled some silver shiny stuff out of their pockets they would have already been toast besides that try to find silver shortsput options for a reasonable spreadprice which are also available to buy i tried the whole day yesterday but at least at my europoor broker i couldnt find a single one what tells you that looks like smart money is not buying the silver rush ampxb anti gme bots these guys are getting their bots more and more angry and aggressive over the last h but why would they still take the effort if they already hit their targets all this shows to my retarded autist smooth brain is that they are in deep fear hey bot guys i just want to quote one of your clients “whats your beef with me im just trying to make a living just like you” i hope you guys got payed in advance because your clients will likely go out of business anyways just to repeat the obvious they try to create fear among you retards and make your diamond hands become weak ass toilet paper to close this part i just want to quote some famous investor from omaha be “fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful” im an autist i dont feel fearful at all i simply cant… but for some reason the bot guys are they seem fearful as fuck to me ampxb short interest ratios so i hope most of you guys realized they simply changed the formula to calculate si rates its basically still in science you would say they normalized the standardization you take your observed value also into account and add it to your base value eventually your maximum number can only be lt or in other terms lt in this specific case you take your number of shorted stocks and add them to the float as a base value then you divide your number of shorted stocks by the base value including shorted stocks which can only be smaller then or in respective inflate the base to make things look completely different… anyways my smooth brain is able to convert the equation to the old standard shortsfloat which is based on ss latest short interest rate just to make it easy for your autist brains shortsshorts float → shorts float gt shorts float → shorts float float or of float in addition you have to keep in mind big players always have taken fines and trials into consideration as costs i dont know what the fines for misinformation regarding number of shorted stocks are but if you are scared to death you should first of all not show it to your retarded smooth brained enemies by recruiting bot armies obviously lying silver bullshit other fud you name it and you are willing to take any risk to survive or fines in this kind of situation probably any kind of fines no matter what ampxb ampxb but why would they do this whats their business with the hfs you ask yourself you guys are threatening soooo many business models in finance and this is the real game changer keep in mind on stock markets you mainly trade the future you have to make scenarios for the upcoming future and there is a horrifying scenario for boomer financial services arising at the horizon but first lets bring it to the crucial point first look for information asymmetries google it or whatever… thats what its all about in the end thats the main reason why big players make shit tons of money from small players its all about information sovereignty or the information monopoly… however you call it the one who is quicker capable to gather more accurate information and hide it from others wins like buying your investment decisions and order limits from robinhood sometimes its even enough to convince your enemy that you are in possession of better information by the way this fight about information sovereignty is exactly what you can observe right now hfs try to convince you retards that they have better and more accurate information about the whole situation so lets come back to the bullet point imagine a huge crowd of people on social platforms gathering more and more accurate information and take investment decisions on that because of declining information asymmetries constantly draining money out of it this will drastically change the current state of the market in means of clients to financial service provider relations making it a more liberated fairer market in some kind the whole industry would lose trillions in the future so yeah you guys did it you scared a big chunk of the whole financial sector not with gme in particular but with this way of investing therefore from the financial industries point of view this transition process must be stopped and delayed at any cost this is literally the clusterfuck for boomer financial services and the worldwide media and wsb are the battlegrounds right now ampxb ampxb but hey im just a short

layk95,None,N/A,my favorite paragraph from the mark cuban ama this morning,Discussion,35,1,TinzoftheBeard,8,in response to someone asking why the stocks are falling this morning supply and demand but in this case it literally could be because the source of demand has been crippled when rh shut it down then cut it back lets put aside why they cut of the greatest source of demand they created a robinhood dive no rh buyers means sellers lower their price to find buyers and they keep on lowering it till they find buyers keep the most natural buyers out of the market and the price keeps on falling then that drop accelerates because the more the stock falls the more owners who bought on margin get margin calls when that margin call happens its brutal they just take your stock send you a fuck you note and sell your stock at the market price no matter how low they just want to get your cash to pay back the loan that then accelerates the selling which then leads to what we are seeing in the market right now with gme in particular so what to do if you can afford to hold the stock you hold i dont own it but thats what i would do why because when rh and the other online brokers open it back up to buyers then we will see what wsb is really made of that is when you get to make it all work i have no doubt that there are funds and big players that have shorted this stock again thinking they are smarter than everyone on wsb i know you are going to hate to hear this but the lower it goes the more powerful wsb can be stepping up to buy the stock again the only question is what broker do you use do you stay with rh who is going to have the same liquidity problems over and over again or do you as a group find a broker with a far far far better balance sheet that wont cut you off and then go ham on wall street,2021-02-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/layk95/my_favorite_paragraph_from_the_mark_cuban_ama/,1612242000

the comments will try to incorporate that into the post as i go or make a followup tomorrow first off my position shares of gme plus calls $ peak value was nearly k this is not financial advice im not an expert etc why should we still hold i know theres a lot of sentiment around solidarity and sticking it to the man and fuck it im down so much anyway none of these are good reasons to hold im here to talk about the actual reasons to hold heres our biggest problem misinformation there is a lot of information being spread around like manure mostly unread mostly undisseminated basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias how do we ensure were not just buying into bullshit by determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now that is what i intend to review and hopefully gather from you apes here today a review of the forces acting on gme fundamental value this isnt relevant right now gme is presently a $share company even with ryan cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass its not worth more than $ until they actually start changing their business model when that happens the value will go up for now above expected online revenue growth doesnt mean shit in the bigger picture momentum this is the biggest reason we hit $share and the biggest reason were still at $ way above fundamental value heres something to consider momentum not the squeeze is why the share price is where it is rather the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard but people are also idiots momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure and can be easily manipulated as weve seen the short squeeze what actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices short sellers who are actually not theoretically pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss and en masse if most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price do you actually think melvin capital was at any point margin called ifwhen they exited they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest to the point that they were straight up given a multibillion dollar bailout by their competitors these people dont play by the same rules as you you fucking braindead monkey the gamma squeeze last friday for the second friday in a row a vast majority of calls expired in the money and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today t rule the theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didnt have good risk models and didnt hedge their calls well enough and so didnt actually own enough underlying shares to hand over and now need to rush to buy them at market price could that be why there was a massive spike from to this afternoon maybe but a gamma squeeze can also backfire all those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy or the margin to borrow that means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationoh best believe it happened and is still happening just to review the hits dtcc andor retail brokers prevent buying artificially suppressing demand for thu price drop and locking up peoples money till they could transfer elsewhere sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling a massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in silver retail brokers cancelling orders restricting limit prices enforcing unwanted stop losses etoro illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands ampxb ok but you knew about all this whats important now is what evidence do we actually have about the current state of play ampxb no really im asking our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information i will edit and update this list as information is shared meanwhile ill try to flesh out a framework as best i can argument the squeeze is not squoze because short interest is still high claim as long as the short interest exceeds the float there is a supply problem for short sellers this may translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time driving the squeeze evidence needed what is the current short interest s partners provides estimates using a model and as of today claim it is only of free floatsource ampxb ortex data provides another estimate using another model and as of yesterday claims it is only mil shares only a million shares difference from ssource ampxb real data the sec releases reported short interest twice a month the most recent data we have is from jan and wasnt released to the public until jan on jan the si was the next report for jan wont be available until feb frankly we cant rely on the real data because its delayed too long to be relevant evidence needed what is the actual free float i still need help finding this i know million shares have been issued overall but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within days if million shorts still need to close how many shares are readily available yahoo finance puts float at mil shares fwiwsource argument there hasnt been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close claim assuming mil shorted not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions evidence someone explain to me how this isnt enough volume for shorts to cover mark cuban said pretty much the same thing in his ama today datetrade volume tuem monm frim thum wedm argument short sellers will are under pressure to close so the squeeze is coming claim short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions and will eventually prefer or be forced to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze evidence needed shorts are on average in a losing position at current share price $ and cant just close right now at profit evidence needed any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further ampxb argument market manipulation shenanigans didnt work and retailers didnt sell off en masse creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply claim price dips happened during low volume trading short ladder market manipulation etc and the longs are holding fast counterevidence the motherfucking $ price drop you dumb fucking nuggets evidence this popular screenshot of fidelitys order ratiosource counterargument order counts dont mean shit for every share traded there is a buyer and a seller so k buyers buy one share each and k sellers sell shares each or k buyers place buy orders for one share each and there are less buyers than sellers overall who knows this strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders evidence needed something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold evidence needed other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders fidelity is just one broker and a retail broker at that hedgies dont trade with fidelity ampxb argument the biggest dips were driven by shortladder attacks during low volume periods claim the decrease in price from to is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling short ladders and not so much by change in momentum evidence at this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors essentially round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices counterargument short ladder attacks are straight up not real conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by wsb itself evidence needed ive seen but cant find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts shares at a time could use that counterargument the artificially reduced volume from robin hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed as rh allows shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker damage to momentum was done but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip right evidence needed that the price dips over the last hours havent been accompanied by massive trading volume im seeing a lot especially compared to thursdays artificial suppression ampxb argument you are here on the vw short squeeze chart claim see how the famous vw short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up thats us right now evidence a single solitary chart counterargument the vw scenario was not the same as the gme play vw share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that porsche had bought up of the float check me on that fact im repeating secondhand info see the big dip after the squeeze how do we know we arent there evidence needed idk some kind of coherent explanation of why vw dipped like that and why a similar dip would be expected in the gme play ampxb ampxb will edit with more my primate fingers are

lay5wi,GME,-29.62%,gme short squeeze what comes next,DD,198,0.95,YeBoiTxm,66,hello all written monday so tomorrow tuesday nd if you dont recognize my name then perhaps you havent seen my posts at the start of all this you can find the original dd here and the preearnings assumptions here things looked bad today and truthfully im surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day at one point last week the stock plummeted to $ and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded it dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed now lets talk about that day why did it go down that is easy insane trading restrictions especially on rh where the majority shareholders place trades but whats interesting to examine iswhy did it go back up my thesis is this was in fact melvin covering retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed melvin is not the only short in the game in fact many new short positions were opened some intentionally others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold some people were selling calls with an $ strike price others upwards of $ many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $ were now stuck holding the bag with a $ strike price on friday one of two things can happen to these people t they will have two business days to cover their losses if able if unable they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover this logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week so what happened today well loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here the extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesnt add up instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress now why would they do this this is a very interesting question if shorts have covered and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down shift attention to silver and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims normally i am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situationsbut this one only has one answer they havent covered if they were covered and out of this then all this other manipulation exists for no reason another question to consider if shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business again this has but one answer there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze the final thing to consider if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock its price should go upright well all of wsb and many retail investors are still adding on this dip now tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor if the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished itm on friday so all contracts that were sold to expire with a strike price of $ or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow technically t is actually so they might extend into wednesday a gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts i would laugh at $ price target but truthfullyi would now call that a minimum despite what today looked like price decrease low volume bullish now there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control if the stock keeps getting purchased and held then regardless of squeeze mechanics the price will rise with the squeeze $ is a fair and minimum assumption if we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further which at that point will have no merit then gme will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int wont be immediately squeezed its interesting to consider a pt when the squeeze is complete tldr if shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left why is trading still restricted what are they are afraid will happen with millions of people still buying more then this price has no reason to go downyet it is that is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade a ladder attack that cant be interfered with is a perfect attack volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering i am not a financial advisor im just a guy that loves logic and reasoning copied off a great dd edit for people claiming the liquidity defense please tell me why trading on tsla was not blocked during its insane short squeeze if that sounds aggressive im sorry im truly trying to find an answer to this

lbepxi,None,N/A,amarin dd,DD,20,0.61,BlackthorneSamurai,63,the company name is thought to mean everlasting or from the sea depending on who you believe both are quite right vascepa is icosapent ethyl a purified and modified omega that when taken on top of a statin think lipitor basically cuts your risk of dying having a heart attack or a stroke by sounds good right lipitor was the best selling drug of all time until humira yet it started out slow in its first year just like vascepaand without a pandemic now we have generic statins with hundreds of millions of patients worldwide taking daily lipitor had its run though just ask pfizer and it still sells tons of cabbage but there is only one vascepa that reduces your triglycerides and reduces your cardiovascular risk funny thing isits not the triglyceride reduction that bestows the benefitmore laterless stokes stents open heart bypass surgeryand death there are many different oils or properly called fatty acids in those over the counter omegas you may take but only this particular one has been shown in double blind randomized trials to work at least two of the others dha and dpa likely actually hurt no one really knows why we think its its powerful antiinflammatory properties of icosapent ethyl or epa vascepa think“it coats the insides of your arteries and puts out the fire connected to the ticking time bomb” for reference see the new england journal of medicine article from called the reducit study also see the evaporate study from that showed coronary artery plaque regression thats rightvascepa likely is liquid draino for your coronaries let that sink in a minute there are two large covid studies reporting in first half of this year called mitigate and prepare—it prepareit will likely read out end of feb mitigate interim around may the thought is the anti inflammatory power of v helps one canadian study presented in december at the national lipid association showed statistics better than remdesivir vascepa may snuff out the cytokines storm that kills you from covid it may also disrupt the viruses transmissibility as covid is wrapped inyou guessed itfatty acids and lipids let that sink in a minute amarin won the fda approval for cvt reduction in dec she hit $ soon after march a nevada judge was hoodwinked into overturning the patents of the original label for treating only patients with triglycerides over to treat pancreatitis thus potentially allowing generics to entreat themselves to amarins three billion a year us market when maturewe only a year in more than of vascepa scripts are for the cardiovascular indicationnot for the skinny label treatment of triglyceridesfor pancreatitis the money is in the cvt risk reductioniethe statin patients world wide amarin spent nearly a billion dollars bringing this indication to market and now generics want to try and steal it all so far so good except for the market perception amarin claims to have the api sources secured thus far there is one generic made by hickma the company that won the court case litigation is still ongoing and amarin is now suing them for infringing on the cvt indication patents that are still quite valid damages could be huge amarin won eu recommendation for the cvt indication in europe on friday and can start marketing likely by april europes market is maybe larger than the us thus far amarin has maintained the us market with hickma currently holding of the market yet the stock cratered from $ to $ in march today she sits just over $ the drop was likely because all thought the us market was completely toast clearly it is not months post generic launch add to this that lovaza still makes up a large part of the prescription omega market and there really is no good reason to ever take lovaza now that vascepa is here and you can see that amrns revenues are going to be huge last year was unaudited $ mill billion tax loss carry over million in cash or investments no debt zero debt price currently $ there seems to be a lot of selling between entities to ladder step her down almost daily since the march debacle despite that she has doubled that the company updated its “change of control” package and policy in an k filed this friday one day after european approval recommendation could mean a buy out is imminent amarin was built for a buy out she a one drug pony but the drug is a doozy i truly believe us can generate $ bill in sales eu $ billion a year approval in china by amarin partner could generate $ bill a year but amarin gets a straight high teens royalty from eddingpharm the chinese owned partner long story short this drug saves lives and will make a lot of money last i looked there were mill shares short with float of million but much more than half the float is locked up the daily shenanigans need to stop the respect and eyes of the world needs to be on vascepa its truly a lifesaver with untold uses and benefits i honestly believe there is a huge covid benefit to being on vascepa and we will soon know lets see what happens when the people get behind a company that has been screwed over and over yet gets back up again because the science of the drug is a once in years

lb0gcj,None,N/A,all wsb stocks are being treated the same by the media theyre not the same,DD,339,0.96,minilip30,78,the media has been covering wsb absolutely atrociously wsb stocks have been rising and falling together for days now even though they are very different stocks that people are in for very different reasons this has the potential to create some bargains i wanted to do a quick rundown for those who are unclear on why the stocks im going to cover are gme amc bb nok and ill touch on slv and why its not a wsb stock gme the squeezening gme was trading at $ a share months ago people on wall street were treating it like it would be the next blockbuster the fear was the people would buy their video games online and make the company obsolete hedge funds started heavily shorting it expecting it to go bankrupt within a few years even if it was short interest is insane they were asking for a squeeze also gamestop is not that much worse positioned than any other brick and mortar retailer the pandemic cost them in the short term but they can survive is macys going out of business because of online shopping maybe eventually but for now theyre trudging along gamestop even has some advantages over other retailers in that they can buy used games for pennies on the dollar and resell them for dimes on the dollar if you do that with clothes youre a goodwill in other words we like the stock there was really good news concerning vaccination so the pandemic selloff started reversing as the stock price came back to prepandemic levels ryan cohen joined the board previous ceo of chewy there was hope for the future trajectory of the company this absolutely screwed the short sellers leading to the short squeeze gamestop has become a short squeeze play its speculative right now it wont be worth $ a year from now and no one believes that but it also wont be worth $ a year from now amc gmes little brother amc has a similar story to gme except less hope the cinema industry has been decimated by the pandemic but that doesnt mean that the company is closing imminently the company became undervalued and with hope that the pandemic was coming to a close the price started coming back to prepandemic levels short sellers got caught with their pants down they got squoze and lost a ton of money amc is different that gme in that cinemas were having huge problems even before the pandemic also unlike gme there is no ebusiness guru joining amcs board i think gme has hope long term whereas i am much more skeptical for amc the short squeeze means that the stock will have crazy volatility in the short term but long term im not sure where it ends up bb not gme blackberry is known for making cell phones for boomers but they have shifted dramatically at this point blackberry is a cybersecurity company bb is also interesting because they are really involved in the cybersecurity of self driving car technology and with the solar winds hack they were listed as a possible beneficiary blackberry has a partnership with amazon and has partnerships in china as well bb is nothing like gme or amc its a medium risk high reward stock that could hit $ within years or could do nothing nok definitely not gme nok is similar to bb in that people think of them for their phones but they dont do that anymore nok is a g company now they have major competitors in europe ericsson and huawei yes that huawei the one that no one trusts because they are probably selling your data to china it is likely that huawei gets regulated out of europe which is a gift to nokia the company has partnerships with tmobile and google nokia is a low risk medium reward type of stock its trading at around $ right now i would be surprised if it didnt hit $ by eoy but i would be just as surprised if it hit $ they look to be giving out a consistent dividend which might bring some big pension accounts on board slv not a wsb stock i think i saw post on slv here and suddenly it is a wsb stock in the media someone posts here about slv every once in a while talking about silver to gold ratios or some shit slv is a scam slv does not create value its a commodity institutional investors are all over it theres no law that says it has to have some ratio to gold literally the first law of the stock market is that past performance does not determine future results notice how slv is the only stock out of all the wsb stocks that is not trending together gme bb nok and amc are wedded to each other even though they are obviously very different slv does its own shit i really think this slv thing was just a way for some hedge fund to cover some sneaking shit they were pulling all that said if gme or amc crashes after the squeeze and that leads all the other wsb stocks to crash bb and nok present huge opportunities i personally am going all in on nok if it goes under $ a share tldr gme and amc are short term high risk high reward short squeeze plays bb is a longer term medium risk high reward play nok is a longer term low risk medium reward play fuck

latzst,HOLD,-0.10%,in other words fucking hold to the moon 🚀🚀🚀💎✋💎,DD,5967,0.98,cheeseburger_daddy,469,🦍 this is not my dd post taken from rstocks submitted by uhoomanorwhatever i am just smoothbrain monke holding on to the moon 🚀💎✋💎 not financial advice i have the retard gme short squeeze what comes next hello all if you dont recognize my name then perhaps you havent seen my posts at the start of all this you can find the original dd here and the preearnings assumptions here things looked bad today and truthfully im surprised and proud that it took this long for us to have a red day at one point last week the stock plummeted to $ and everyone seemingly forgets that detail simply because it quickly rebounded it dropped all the way down nonetheless when trading restrictions were imposed now lets talk about that day why did it go down that is easy insane trading restrictions especially on rh where the majority shareholders place trades but whats interesting to examine iswhy did it go back up my thesis is this was in fact melvin covering retail investors were completely locked out of trade yet the price skyrocketed melvin is not the only short in the game in fact many new short positions were opened some intentionally others unintentionally due to lacking the funds required to cover the calls that were sold some people were selling calls with an $ strike price others upwards of $ many of these calls were executed and people who never thought it would surpass $ were now stuck holding the bag with a $ strike price on friday one of two things can happen to these people t they will have two business days to cover their losses if able if unable they will have to open a short position to borrow the shares that they promised to cover this logic is what led to new short positions opening last week and certainly will mean more short positions opened this week so what happened today well loads of people were still locked out of trading and a price drop happened naturally this was some longs taking profits but the volume is key here the extremely low volume compared to the price drop simply doesnt add up instead it looks like a series of ladder attacks and ping ponging between hedge funds to drive the price down without any buyers to counter their progress now why would they do this this is a very interesting question if shorts have covered and there is no more fear of losses then why are they still trying to drive the price down shift attention to silver and having the media run amuck with countless baseless claims normally i am a fan of logic and reasoning and like to break things down to multiple situationsbut this one only has one answer they havent covered if they were covered and out of this then all this other manipulation exists for no reason another question to consider if shorts were covered or short interest was extremely low then why is trading still restricted if there is no danger of a squeeze that would put brokers out of business again this has but one answer there is still a danger for a massive short squeeze the final thing to consider if people are willing and want to buy and hold a stock its price should go upright well all of wsb and many retail investors are still adding on this dip now tomorrow will be an interesting day to monitor if the price is maintained or lifted it will lead to another gamma squeeze due to all of the contracts that finished itm on friday so all contracts that were sold to expire with a strike price of $ or lower will need to be covered by tomorrow technically t is actually so they might extend into wednesday a gamma squeeze will lead to the final short squeeze and in previous posts i would laugh at $ price target but truthfullyi would now call that a minimum despite what today looked like price decrease low volume bullish now there is always possibilities but luckily this is one we can control if the stock keeps getting purchased and held then regardless of squeeze mechanics the price will rise with the squeeze $ is a fair and minimum assumption if we cannot outlast the short attacks or trading gets restricted further which at that point will have no merit then gme will remain one of the most interesting stocks now that their are tons of longs on it and short int wont be immediately squeezed its interesting to consider a pt when the squeeze is complete tldr if shorts truly covered and there is no more squeeze left why is trading still restricted what are they are afraid will happen with millions of people still buying more then this price has no reason to go downyet it is that is due to trading restrictions and hedge funds taking advantage of the fact that no one could trade a ladder attack that cant be interfered with is a perfect attack volume has been far to low to justify price action or even half of shorts covering i am not a financial advisor im just a guy that loves logic and reasoning edit for people claiming the liquidity defense please tell me why trading on tsla was not blocked during its insane short squeeze if that sounds aggressive im sorry im truly trying to find an answer to this

lawos6,TR,-12.91%,serious $tr dd this still has room to run,DD,27,0.78,huge__ackman_,24,some people who missed out on the broader nongme squeeze play might be hesitant to get involved with another one of the high shortinterest names now that theyve run up x but could you imagine that one of these short squeeze names not only has a lot more room to squeeze and hasnt been restricted by many brokerages but is still a value play even after the massive run on shorts thats what we have with tr its been pointed out that tr is heavily shorted with of its float short but if youre looking for squeeze potential you should be paying at least just as much attention to days short if a name has limited liquidity the shorts will have a hard time exiting their positions regardless of the nominal short interest days short on gme was just as of midjanuary and even at its peak reached no higher than days way back in july amc is just day short and reached no higher than in october tr its still days short as of the same date gme days amc day tr days thats higher squeeze risk by an order of magnitude going by that metric the shorts are m shares deep in their short positions on tr but the stock typically trades only k shares per day and it didnt pick up nearly as much volume as the other squeeze candidates like amc and expr last week while amc expr etc are up x on the squeeze trade tr is up only but if tr even begins to make a move similar to theirs the shorts will have a very hard time exiting due to the tight float and limited liquidity and the stock could squeeze very very hard what makes this so potent is the mechanics of the float just of trs shares trade freely compare this to for gme and amc and as high as for bb and expr there are only so many shares out there that the shorts could possibly cover where are the rest of these shares theyre with ceo ellen gordon who owns of the common and of class b shares another insider owns another of the common and of the class b gordon has been on the board for years and there is no record of her selling a single share going back to at least in fact no insider has sold a share since and before that these are the ultimate diamond hands this is effectively a closelyheld business that just happens to trade publicly worried that we might get burned by insiders like we did on amc with silver lake executing the massive convert and making it easier for shorts to cover not here the insiders dont sell and the shorts will be stuck covering on the tiny float and compare the risk in tr to the other squeeze plays at this stage of the trade expr amc etc are all up x over the past week but are all companies that were and are under legitimate fundamental pressure as they were even before covid and facing real liquidity issues which is of course why they were so heavily shorted tr is up just on the squeeze but is absolutely fine financially sales have been steady and remarkably consistent at $m for years and are down just due to covid it has over $m of cash on its balance sheet and no debt it generates consistent free cash flow which was as high as $m last year this is a brand that everyone knows with no real lasting fundamental pressures and is not going away anytime soon the kicker this thing probably has upside on the fundamentals its very likely that company gets bought out by a strategic buyer once the longtime ceo now years old passes away for how much tr did $m of gross profit in lets say it gets bought out by hersheys which probably shares all of trs distribution channels and could wipe out just about all of its extremely bloated sales marketing and administrative spend in a buyout taxaffect trs gross profit at hsys effective tax rate of apply hsys forward pe of x divide by m shares outstanding… …and you see that tr could easily end up getting bought out for upwards of $ per share and that may not be too far off so why is it still trading at $ per share even after the run on heavilyshorted names beats me but im buying at these levels as is whoever made those large bullish option purchases late last friday… tldr this is not just another lottery ticket short squeeze play thats already been carried into the stratosphere this is an earlystage squeeze that never got picked up by wsb quite as much as some of the others – and even after the onceinageneration broadbased squeeze this one hasnt reached nearly its potential given the low float and limited liquidity which makes its days short ratio x higher than the other squeeze candidates and which will make it very very hard for shorts to cover tr is up just while the others are up x and its not even trading where it should be on the fundamentals if youre looking for another squeeze candidate and one which the brokers havent restricted as heavily but are antsy about how extended the highshortinterest basket might be – this is your “value squeeze” play and honestly why didnt this one get picked up as much by wsb what stock could be more memable than tootsie roll everyone knows it everyone loves it…who wouldnt be tweeting about tootsie if this got some play by the way unlike amc whose theaters are closed across much of the country tr is a company that we could support directly go out and buy some tootsie rolls think about the power of the crowd that wsb showed in bringing gme stock to light and apply it to tr if we get just of us wsb retards buying the count boxes on their website for our imaginary girlfriends for valentines day thats over $m in sales more than of ttm revenue heres an opportunity

lbaww3,APHA,30.24%,dd on apha,DD,329,0.92,myitchurballsy,247,i think it is time i make a dd post that has nothing to do with a meme stonk i am unable to use emojis off my laptop so please excuse me for not having enough rocket ships but i promise you this rocket ship is fueling up and we are a couple months away from blast off if not sooner why should you trust me i am an economics major with a concentration in entrepreneurship and a minor in sales i love money more than hookers love blow and i intend on making a lot of money so i can afford the hookers that like blow i go to a pretty prestigious university and i love how wallstreetbets can connect smart money with autist money i am all in on apha with my entire life savings because as warren buffett would say diversification is a protection against ignorance it makes very little sense for those who know what theyre doing and i know what i am doing so i full sent it ampxb why apha they are conservative with their spending is what got me hooked first compared to other marijuana companies like acb or tilray they arent riddled with debt right off the back ill get to the tilray merger in a bit this company has the cash on hand to purchase a mso multistate operator as soon as the us legalizes and my bet is that they are going to go for a mso that has a heavy presence in florida as the cfo stated in an ama on reddit that florida is where the market is not california the difference between apha and any mso or other lp is the fact that apha merging with tilray creates the first mco or multicountry operator this means the company will be taking a piece of the cake from multiple cakes you dont need to be in america or canada whenever you are directly engaged in multiple operations all over the world that increase your market share to be worldwide ampxb with apha and tilray merging which stonk do you buy easy apha the arbitrage play has apha being changed to of tilray share currently tilray trades at x the current apha price this means that the gap has to close before the merger but is tilray going to go down with all the pro marijuana news coming out no apha has to go up to close the gap and today alone apha is up based on pro marijuana legalization news but wait tilray is up which means the gap is only getting wider just like your wifes pussy after letting her boyfriends have a turn since youve been so busy focusing on your gme stonk going down due to market manipulation ampxb the financials of apha are strong they finally posted a profit of eps which may seem like little bitch shit but in reality most cannabis companies havent hit profitability yet so they are ahead of the game the one great thing about their financials is that sweetwater brewing wasnt factored into the earnings report which is awesome insert hellllaaa rocket emojis here they are already turning a profit and then they are going to be adding more profits from a brewery that has strong revenue growth and turns a profit onto their balance sheet while other companies have to figure out how to keep demand up after the holiday season apha has a raft to float on since sweetwater provides a great level of float to the company i will post all relevant news articles at the end the merge with tilray makes this combined company a player in canada portugal france and then sweetwater gives them us brand recognition how does a beer company give us brand recognition look up the sweetwater brand and you will see that this is a beer company for stoners and that is exactly what apha needed right now the stock is stilling at $ which is still relatively low i can see this hitting anywhere from $ eoy and like i said i have my entire life savings in this stonk because i know the end of prohibition means the chance for the next anheuser busch which apha is best positioned to become theres even more reasons to invest but im sure you get the point this is going to be huge and if youre looking for a play in the marijuana sector this is your best option go on the weedstocks subreddit if you want even more verification or to see some alternative opinions i made this post as a throwback to the good ole days to when wsb wasnt only about gme and amc but also new emerging sectors this is a great stock and i wouldnt have taken the time out of my busy schedule unless the time to blast off was fast approaching listen or dont i am gonna make tendies i just want to share the wealth sweetwater is actually a very big deal that is overlooked they are expanding into more states which is simply creating a distribution chain for aphatilray to distribute their product through imagine already having warehouses sales reps and shipping routes established before the us legalizes apha is going to be an mso and mco the only thing that scares me is that democrats have said they dont want big companies coming in to sweep up market share whenever minorities have been directly impacted by the war on drugs could go both ways but sweetwater provides somewhat of a foundation for the balance sheet and then the intrinsic value of the relationshipsbrand recognition that will already be established before any other lps can get into the market will have aphatilray the clear cut winner of the lps i strongly urge anyone that wants to get further into the marijuana investing space to visit the sub reddit weedstocks rather than spamming wsb with these types of posts whenever their is a different sub dedicated to it i have been a member of wsb and weedstocks for over a year and both subs have

lbc5gq,GME,-29.62%,gmes data irregularities,Discussion,1337,0.98,Embarrassed-Ice-2971,297,today i found another irregularity in gmes data when i looked at the positioncost distribution chart for gme after todays close i was expecting it to be very different compared to yesterdays chart since assuming paper hands have sold they would change this distribution significantly and todays volume seemed to be high however i found something fascinating todays chart was a superset of yesterdays chart in other words it looks like some shares were added to the float and it looks like almost none of the previous shares has moved diamond hands goes here take a look position cost distribution comparison between and webulls description of what this chart represents is the following source webull if im reading this correctly this means two things it looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float people actually seem to be diamond handing i can see four possible explanations for the new shares add a comment if you see other possibilities gamestop offered shares this didnt happen as far as i know an institution that had shares that werent in the float sold his shares i cant find any filings especially with this many shares but there could be a delay short sellers borrowed shares that were not in the float which probably were covered and returned before and shorted them again naked shorting the reason why i think and are unlikely is that almost all of the sell orders i saw today were trying to bring the price down so an insider or an institution that is not short probably wasnt the one selling they are also probably in a blackout period but im not sure i think is more likely than so i think someone was shorting the shit out of gme today increasing the short interest considerably but heres the thing at the end of the day these new shares seem to be not that many and the same chart seem to be showing that all of the previous shares are already locked i think these shares will be locked in a few dayshours as well if they havent been locked already so this somewhat guarantees a close to infinity short interest furthermore given that all of these shares were shorted at a relatively low price so i believe that whoever did is doing this is just digging his own grave im not sure if this continues or not depends on how many shares they can borrow from institutions but it made me feel better to see people dont seem to be paper handing that much ps i wish webull would put a proper xaxis on this chart that would be very useful ps to secgovernment agencies it seems like you dont care about the retail investors but let me give you another incentive if you dont stop these shortselling morons from blowing themselves up over and over again i think you might end up having a legitimate market crashfinancial crisis on your hands it doesnt matter how much money these folks have since these guys are at mercy of the shareholders the supply of shares is extremely low and the demand is extremely high even though the brokerages have artificially reduced the demand for now from what im seeing on this sub and from the data people dont seem to have plans to sell below $k$k per share i wouldnt be surprised if that moves up to $k$k per share if gme sp reaches $k$k do the math yourselves disclaimer im not a financial adviser and the content of this post is not financial advice this is for entertainment purposes only and purely speculative even though it might look otherwise ive been long gme and have a lot of gme shares i also added a few weekly calls today edit tldr it seems like today 🦧 did 💎 🙌 🐻 attacked edit someone said there is another possible explanation call writers might have dumped their shares if last weeks expired calls were canceled if they hedged them earlier this can also explain the added shares and the dump since market makers might have an incentive to kill next weeks call options,2021-02-02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc5gq/gmes_data_irregularities/,1612242000

digital world but the fundamentals remain the same this is a long post and i apologize but rather than just join the echo chamber and shout 💎🤲🚀 etc lets take a minute and really assess where were at and where weve come from this is not telling anyone to 📄🤲 quite the opposite in fact as it stands i bought at $ the night shit really turned pear shaped on paper and i watched the initial investment jump up to just short of $ i was grinning about it thinking id timed it just right moments later the market was halted share buying restricted prices began to plunge and continue to plunge day after day i have then watched the shit storm unfold between then and now but ive learnt a bunch and become almost addicted to wanting to know more ampxb knowledge is power ampxb ampxb we have all heard this

fuckery with the ladder attacks the blatant fud campaigns on the media the bots the busted brokers trolls and everything else that has been thrown against you is you learned you learned what wall street is capable of what they will stoop to what to expect next time how they are doing this the tactics they use and just for a second place yourself in their shoes the big guys have the lifestyle

is still relevant and by the luck of the gaming gods $gme was the share that the big brains yes people like rdeepfuckingvalue spotted and deemed to be a good investment ampxb now think further along if the stocks were something mundane like gourds fuck off copy pasta bots youre mildly annoying and none of us care we enjoy clicking the 💩 reactions on your repetitive shitposts do you think the

alone initially i wanted to post pics graphs explanations about everything you can readily find online so you would be educated so you would know that this isnt over yet far from it in fact but the more i look around the more i see people who just need a nudge to investigate things themselves ampxb remember knowledge is power ampxb due diligence is needed invest only what you can afford or risk noone can tell you specifically what is best for you so research that smooth brain check out the posts already in here great for explaining some of the tactics and thought processes of the other side a fairly well researched graph to show how they aggressively ladder attacked us a good post about shorts a good post about gamestop in general and how even if you feel like youve lost it all at the moment hold the company is far from done and will experience growth despite this the shorts ladder attacks all of it if you believe in the company then holding regardless is the key a literal billionaire telling you if you can afford it hold ampxb i could post a more links to posts comments and people doing epic dd whether they came from a financial background or are just a smooth brain

lbg9ha,GME,75.96%,takeaways from gme where do we go from here,Discussion,122,0.83,buffalo8,210,the free market isnt free i have learned a lot in the last two weeks and i hope that some of you have as well and im not talking about the fundamentals of investment trading or strategy im talking about the mechanisms at play that tilt the market in favor of one group of people over another obviously this is an everevolving situation but i think its worthwhile to take the time to reflect on some of the key takeaways from the ordeal and start thinking about how we both as a community and as individuals can protect ourselves against falling prey to the same mistakes twice im not going to comment on whether there was intentional market manipulation on the part of hedge funds through all of this its immaterial to my thesis what was exposed first and foremost in my mind is the uneven playing field that exists between institutional and retail investors if possible we should seek to find a way to negate those advantages andor mirror them for the retail investor ill get into some ideas as to how this might be achieved later but first lets dig into the advantages themselves advantages afforded to the institutional investor access to assets one of the fundamental assumptions of the free market is that equal access to assets ought to be provided to those with means to purchase those assets hence there is an expectation that brokerages act in all cases as a neutral party an arbiter between a buyer and seller meeting on equal footing the events of last thursday show us this is not the case many if not most brokerages restricted access to an indemand asset leading to an artificial decrease in the value of that product as retail was allowed to sell freely but not to buy freely again this is not commentary on whether or not this was an intended effect only an observation that it was the effect that occurred in my opinion rh had so little liquidity available they would never have been able to handle the volume and were fucked either way institutional investors do not rely on brokerages the same way a retail investor does instead trading directly between one another this creates a submarket that exists directtoseller that retail investors couldnt dream of as such they have much more control over the actual trading they take part in moreover insofar as the possibility of a restriction exists on those that fit a particular profile that cannot exist on those who fit another profile it creates a situation that can warp supply and demand on a macro scale access to information this one is quite a bit simpler institutional investors have access to algorithms that can predict and execute on market moves uptothemillisecond data on marketwide trends in some cases even access to trends in buy and sell limits that can inform how best to execute their next big move in short while the data accessible to the retail investor is improving at a rapid rate it pales in comparison to that available to the institutional investor access to capital the impact of the disparity in access to capital manifests itself primarily in three ways first the sheer amount of capital that these institutional investors can draw from affords them the ability to singlehandedly impact the market for a stock this is why gme went down into the low single digits to begin with along with the help of what were almost definitely buck naked shorts which are illegal as fuck this ability to move the market is an even greater advantage when you consider the ramifications of the fact that what the people of this subreddit have been attempting in trying to execute the peoples short squeeze™ is essentially the same thing so in that sense were on an even playing field right wrong in order for our side to achieve the desired effect we have to have a level of solidarity and commitment to the plan that in most cases is completely unachievable as soon as a critical mass of diamond hands become paper hands the whole thing falls apart now imagine what would have happened if melvin werent a single source of capital and instead a collection of millions of individuals each with their own free will realistically half of them would have paperhanded out long before they shorted of the free float of gme and this whole situation would never have gotten to this point second access to capital is only increased when you consider the willingness of others with just as much capital to bail institutional investors out when their position is all but dead this is how you end up with the onholy trinity that is citroncitadelmelvin all playing the same short position on the bet that there cant possibly enough capital on the receiving end of their play to make them lose there is nothing even close to this kind of networking available to the retail investor finally access to capital renders regulatory fines effectively meaningless if institutional investors can break the law in order to save their firm billions and it only costs them a few million youd better believe theyll do it every time their business is built on maximizing profit at all costs whatever moral compass they possess is a tertiary priority meanwhile if you or i get caught talking nonsense on a yahoo messageboard theres a very real possibility we go to jail mitigating disparities of access so the game is rigged weve always known that but the average joe among us is finally getting a glimpse into just how thats achieved and that has the potential to empower us in ways that weve never before been empowered if you dont know how youre getting fucked youll never see the dildo coming but if you know what to expect you can chop it off at the balls before it makes its way inside you thats what my dad always told my anyways anything from this point forward are just my ideas about how we might address these disparities but the key here is that we start having the discussions if every idea i pose gets torn down because its retarded and im sure that they all are ill still consider it a win if it starts a discussion about how we as a collective can work our way out from under the might of this behemoth i think its time we start to completely reimagine the way that small money invests and that wed be best served by creating our own secondary market for securities that exists in parallel to and completely independent from the existing stock exchanges of the world this secondary market should be entirely free of the influence of big money and serve as a platform for the transparent and honest trading of securities so how do we achieve these goals heres a list of guiding principles ive come up with this marketplace should be open at all times without closures or halts to the sale of any security member traders have access to all their assets at all times to ensure this no person or collective should have access to assets on the exchange in the way a brokerage would the exchange should exist as an infrastructure for the holding of assets in or movement of assets into out of and between one another such a marketplace should seek to be as transparent as possible in every aspect and allow for builtin avenues for both direct and communitywide communication between its member traders to prevent the manipulation of this exchange limits should exist for maximum allowable account size and maximum allowable assets to be transferred into but not out of an account this allows an individual to make a hypothetically infinite amount of money while disallowing the ability for any single actor to exert undue influence over the market no liquidity should be required by the exchange itself to achieve this end trading should occur directly between individuals and no trading on margin should be allowed all accounts should be linked to existing brokeragebank accounts belonging to one person and validated against govissued id this prevents badfaith actors from attempting to exert undue influence on the market by opening multiple accounts all members profiles display a history of all trades completed by individual but not current positions or transfers of assets in or out this allows for a full log of market trends available to all traders without providing an excess of information that might give other individuals an advantage in trading stocks only no short positions dont get me wrong shorts have a purpose but the concept of borrowing shares and reselling them later is antithetical to the idea of each account having in it only whatever assets that individual currently owns all intramarket trades and trends should be visible to all member traders i hope youve enjoyed the musings of a hopeless retard my ideas are probably garbage but theyre garbage born of a desire to find a better way even if i havent done that myself i hope that we can do it together apes together strong have a good night edit pretty sure its auto mod but every insightful response ive

lbwou3,None,N/A,sharp increase in exempt short volume,Discussion,127,0.96,Tartania,28,i saw some recent posts highlighting finras daily posted short sale volume data one thing i found interesting is that not only does short volume for gme increase to greater than of total volume on jan but on jan the exempt short sale volume increases significantly as a percent of total volume x increase from th to th as we all know the th is the day that brokerages were forced to shut off memestocks and when we saw what many have claimed to be a major coordinated attack to drive down the price over the course of a few minutes to trigger long margin calls and stop loss orders ampxb here is what this same data looks like for some other securities over the same time frame i took particular note that bb had a sudden increase in this exempt short volume which seems to match up with a sudden downward movement in its price yesterday morning although the overall short volume decreases so not sure what total impact that had on the price ampxb what is exempt short volume here is how investopedia describes it though the sec oversees brokers who issue shortsale orders they do not execute regularly scheduled audits or required regularly filed reports by brokers instead the sec expects brokerdealers to be self regulating by maintaining their own records which are subject to audit at any time with this in mind brokerdealers are required to document their polices for how they mark orders as exempt and if audited provide evidence that they have followed their documented policies and procedures brokerdealers therefore mark an order short exempt if they believe it qualifies for an exception the primary exception is the use of nonstandard pricing quotes for trade execution that means that if prices come in outside the national best bid or offer nbbo they can initiate a shortsale order that they judge would have qualified as an uptick in more orderly markets marking for these orders is signified by sse all orders marked sse will be closely checked by selfregulatory organizations and the sec for compliance with regulation sho exceptions i dont know jack shit about what this means and im not a financial advisor which is why im asking for someone who knows more about this to explain the significance of this does this help support the argument that hedgiesbrokers are circumventing the nbbo for ladder attacks when luld rule is triggered were there frequent enough trading halts since jan th for this to have a significant impact aapl and ford have very small but nonexistent data for exempt short volume and im not aware of any limit rules applied to them over the last few days so where did their exempt short volume come from my position is shares of gme at $ small long positions in some of the other securities mentioned but gme is by far the biggest,2021-02-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbwou3/sharp_increase_in_exempt_short_volume/,1612328400

constantly parroting i told you so but with the pdufa date of defencath only days away now im going to be posting the amazing dd by uissapunk evaluating the approval and buyout potential of cormedix

out on potential tendies here are my positions awesome dd by uissapunk below hopefully this sub hasnt gone full rall and people still are interested in this shit gtcrmd cormedix has been my golden goose since july i believe they will either partnerup or more likely imo get bought out i am going to explain my reasoning why either way i think this has the most upside in the market right now i own lots of shares and options trying to time the explosion gt gtthey developed a catheterlock solution solution that helps reduce infections called defencath formerly called neutrolin this is a huge issue in the world and hundreds of thousands of people die from this annually with a mortality rate of about gt gtin the midst of the largest phase trial for hd it was halted due to efficacy by the data safety monitoring board meaning the board saw all they needed and the results were so convincing there was no need to continue the trial the stock went from $ to $ the next day the p value is from the trial over times better than the p value necessary to equate this to a successful trial aka they knocked it out the park gt gtabout months ago the company conducted a reversesplit to get the price over $ and entice institutions and hedge funds to buy in much heavier most funds dont touch stocks unless they are over $ gt gtright now it is trading at $ which is $ presplit the market cap is only $ million the market for hemodialysis catheter locks is over $ billion for oncology and other indications it brings it to over $ billion many believe the fda will approve this for all indications which will be a huge deal i think this company will be bought out by big pharma gt gtsome facts and reasons why i think this is so bullish and also gets bought out or enters a substantial partnership gt gtp value of is so amazing i cannot overstate how important this data point is to the company and more importantly the fda gt gtthe company received priority review from the fda and fast track status which puts them basically ahead of the line for the fda to review gt gtthe nda was accepted by the fda at the end of august gt gtthe pdufa date date the fda will decide approval by is february th gt gtthe product is currently approved and on sale in europe but they use an entirely different process for catheter lock solutions and this just does not fit into their model so it does not sell well there at all completely different story in the us and i can go into detail on what the differences are and why it is a nonfactor here gt gtthe board of directors is filled with people over the

the company for peanuts gt gtcormedix said they plan to hire a team of sales people to being selling the product no job listings anywhere and no where to apply i work in staffing and there is no way they are planning to do this and have it ready by february gt gtupon approval they have years of exclusivity meaning only they can sell the product very attractive to pfizer who has the edge on the catheterlock $ billion annual market at the moment gt gti believe this is a huge reason this will be bought out year exclusivity clock starts the day defencath is approved cormedix cant waste time building a sales team a company like pfizer or jampj will want to buy this asap so they receive the entire year timeframe to dominate the market gt gtj m p set a price target of $ today gt gttruist bank set a price target of $ last week now $ gt gtthe ceo khoso baluch states on every earnings call that they will maximize shareholder value and are always looking to enter strategic partnerships they have indicated they will absolutely be looking for partners to help market oncology and other indications of the products market gt gtthis is very important they received the right to go after lpad which allowed them to end their trial and not conduct another phase trial this is a very new process the fda has rolled out to help drugs and products that have lifesaving capabilities to receive approval through a much more streamlined and faster process it cuts red tape it is not as good as regular approval because the company will need to have certain info on the labels think about cigarette packaging with warnings on it etc it will allow them to sell the drug but not to the extent full approval would most likely allow what is important here is this allows cormedix to receive approval through either the regular means or through lpad basically gives them another shot at approval if the committee is nervous about approving a product that had less trials than a typical product would but the fda is really behind the lpad process and cormedix is the nd company ever to have a shot at receiving it the fda wants other companies to go after this and to make it attractive so it is selfserving of them to approve defencath as a good example and case study gt gtthe market is $ billion for hemodialysis which is what the trial was done for but their chief medical officer at cormedix stated a catheter is a catheter when asked if he expects the fda to just approve for all indications gt gtif approved for all indications the market goes from $ billion annually to over $

lc4bfv,AN,26.18%,dd on the greek symbols and options explained and an analysis of a call option and an example the final paper,DD,147,0.9,dustmode,30,using the greeks to analyze a call option contract for cant stop wont stop corporation ampxb example $ strike price call exp feb $c current price bid x $ last x x ask x current greeks for contract these are important for calculations δ delta γ gamma θ theta ν vega p rho ampxb what is delta and how is it used delta is a useful metric to help traders measure the impact that movement in an underlying security will have on the value of their option positions delta is not a static number—it fluctuates due to a number of factors including the price of the underlying security time to expiration and volatility the standard definition of delta is change in the option price ÷ change in the stock price why is delta important measuring expected change in option price delta can be used to calculate how much an options premium is theoretically expected to change in response to a $ move in the underlying security for example a call option with a delta of would be expected to rise in value by about $ if the underlying stock or etf rises by $ calculating the percentage of price risk delta also represents the percentage of price risk of stock ownership that is currently represented in the option so a call option with a delta of has of the price risk versus owning the stock outright if an investor wanted a greater or lesser amount of price risk they could choose an option with higher or lower deltas determining the probability that an option will expire in the money finally delta measures the approximate probability that at expiration the option will be inthemoney by at least $ or more therefore a call with a delta of only has a chance at that moment in time that the stocks price will be higher than the options strike price at expiration delta every $ up in stock price $ what is gamma and how is it used gamma is another widely used metric for options trading it is most often used by traders with large positions but grasping how it works can help any trader gain a better understanding of how options behave the standard definition of gamma is change in the delta ÷ change in the stock price why is gamma important gamma measures the rate at which an options delta changes as the underlying security moves the gamma of an option reflects the change in the delta in response to a $ move in the underlying security for example a call option with a gamma of and a delta of would be expected to change to a delta if the underlying stock or etf rises by $ ampxb delta gamma deltagamma every $ up in the stock price $ ampxb what is theta and how is it used theta measures the impact that the passage of time will have on an options price the standard definition of theta is change in the option price ÷ one day change in time theta represents how much an options premium is expected to decay per day with all other market factors and variables remaining the same for example a call option valued at $ with a theta of $ is expected to be worth about $ tomorrow theta can change as the options get closer to expiration for example options with a significant time premium eg those with strike prices closest to the current underlying security price tend to see theta growing larger as expiration approaches another thing to keep in mind theta is exponential not linear that means the time decay of an option accelerates more each day as it moves closer to expiration why is theta important time decay is an important concept in options trading theta is the metric that quantifies it so that you can estimate how quickly you might make or lose money on an option strategy as time passes however remember that theta like all the greeks is a theoretical estimate of what is expected to occur over time on any given day supply and demand in the market will determine whether an options price rises or falls ampxb theta decay minus $ per day current price $ per day x minus $ $ price tomorrow if nothing changes what is vega and how is it used vega measures the impact that changes in implied volatility will have on the price of an option contract volatility can have a major impact on your options trade so vega can be important for assessing the riskreward profile of a given strategy the standard definition of vega is change in the option price ÷ percentagepoint change in implied volatility specifically vega represents the expected change in an options price for a one percentage point change in its implied volatility for example if implied volatility rises from to a call option with a vega of would be expected to rise in value by $ why is vega important vega plays a critical role in determining the riskreward potential of a potential option trade if traders believe an option to be overvalued or undervalued they may look at vega to decide which options andor options strategies have the most profit potential vega for every change in implied volatility iv $ per pointie up would mean $ x points $ today was iv thats crazy volatility the week high for iv was theres a chance this breaks tomorrow $ x $ potential implied volatility for gamestop corporation current wk avg wk high wk low ampxb what is rho and how is it used rho measures an option contracts sensitivity to interest rate changes and is expressed as the expected change in an options value given a one percentage point change in interest rates the standard definition of rho is change in the option price ÷ percentagepoint change in interest rates how is rho used for example a call option with a rho of would be expected to rise in value by $ if interest rates rise from to rho can be positive or negative but has the strongest impact on longerterm options and is often considered less important than the other greeks by traders who focus on shorterterm options why is rho important in a lowinterest rate environment rho has a less measurable impact on option prices compared to delta vega gamma and theta still it is another metric that can be used to help understand how options are influenced by interest rates and may have some bearing on longerterm options positions ampxb rho $ per change in interest rate of borrowing sharesie if borrowed shares interest rate goes from to points x $ extra to the option price ampxb the summary for every $ move up in the share price tomorrow the options price will increase based on case two case one iv is and interest rate increases by and common share price increases by $ $gamma theta vega rho total basic greeks $ $ $ for every move in iv $ for every loan interest increase $ total basic greeks current option premium price $ ampxb case two iv is and interest rate increases from to and common share price increases by $gamma theta vega rho $ $ $ x move in iv $ $ for every loan interest increase $ $ current option premium price so per every $ move in share price the analyzed option premium price increased $ or from last price on of $ ampxb ampxb tldr so per every $ move in share pricethe analyzed option cant stop wont stop corporation c increases $ or based upon case two with iv increase and interest rate increase ampxb if there is continuous buying and hodling of shares and buying call options and the share price goes higher bc of diamond hands and buying by oldcomers and newcomers the options price will continue to rise every $ increase in share price based upon case and can be even more as iv goes higher or interest rate borrowing goes higher ampxb what would happen to the calls if the stock price rises every $ exponential growth possibly and the final squoze the share price needs to increase in a dramatic and volatile fashion if and

lc7nlc,U,-34.28%,ujbgdi game design,Discussion,15,0.75,hewhoziko53,5,originally from ujbgdi i am not original author give any and all awards to that guy hes a fucking a game designer and sees shit i dont dearest mods lt im trying to get this post approved but i am being blocked here it is for anyone that stumbles onto this thing i put an insane amount of time into meme stocks the infinite game and how the game has changed the players prepandemic wsb member with aspergers here – i have designed stupid board games and video games for years and while i have spent a ton of time watching whats going on and thinking about everything i was suddenly reminded about the game design concept of finite and infinite games its worth viewing the current situation under this lens and i wanted to shine some light on how this game design concept factors into meme stocks and what everyone including myself has missed until today all of this is my opinion it is not a recommendation or financial advice or a call to action even if it looks like it my positions are long gme and nok in small amounts because i am poor but i got in super early on both so i have no plans to sell finite and infinite games for those that have never heard of this it comes from a book with the same name yes i can read and even smoothbrains can understand the main idea finite games have a clear end and the purpose of a player is to win football is a finite game monopoly is a finite game getting your stock to a certain target price and selling is a finite game infinite games do not have a clear end and the purpose of a player is to stay in the game longer than the opponent the game can even outlast the players running a business is an infinite game exploration is an infinite game the cold war was an infinite game when finiteminded players enter a finite game or when infiniteminded players enter an infinite game the game functions properly but things get wild when a player sits down at the wrong game the vietnam war im stealing this section from the beginning of simon sineks incredible talk because i am lazy and it fits the point im trying to make the us got into the vietnam war to win a war if the enemy ended up flying a white flag victory is achieved and uhhh freedom they were playing to win the game finitemindset and they won a lot of battles but the vietnamese were fighting for their lives and their way of life their goal was to get the other player to drop out or simply outlast the opposition until they left which the us did and the vietnamese were willing to fight to the last man to do it the united states won a ton of battles but the vietnamese won the war what type of game is the stock market we can answer this a lot of ways but my simplest take is this the stock market is a weird beast because its an infinite game outlast your opponents but most people play with a finite mindset a player tries to get their stock to hit a certain target price and they cash out win and leave or play again pick a new stock during the past few weeks a tremendous amount of players entered the meme stock game and used orders and limits to win so they could leave their opponents did the same even when the rules are lopsided the game functions as both sides 🐃 vs 🌈🐻 try to cheerlead and do whatever they can to fight for their side short or long 📉 enter robinhood 📉 its no secret that last thursday the rules of the game drastically changed for players in meme stocks as millions of players were suddenly knocked out impacting the score for every other player demand is directly linked to price by artificially collapsing demand during one of the biggest bull runs in history a referee robinhood essentially robbed all the players on one side of the game to benefit the opposing players this is why there was a sudden and immediate outpouring of powerful people from all angles condemning the action the referee broke the game meme stocks fall because the demand is suppressed and no timeout was called how finiteminded players adjusted players of the finite game that got robbed now came to a crossroads they could ⁠hold and keep playing 💎🙌 hoping their meme stock would hit their target price ⁠cut their losses and sell 🧻🤚 to keep a smaller profit or prevent deeper losses the players that were benefited by the shakedown also had a choice and that choice looked different because of their advantage ⁠stay with the meme stocks hoping to get their stock to the target price or better ⁠cash out and maybe move to other stocks immediately because holy god this meme stock well is poisoned and the volatility is insane at the end of the day all these players are looking to cash out at a number so even though they are on different sides and meme stocks are crazy right now the game is still playable if you havent fallen asleep yet here is the part where things go off the rails and no one is talking about it because no one has put the right words to it yet a huge number of these finiteminded players have been turned into infiniteminded players through the cacophony of all you pasteeating morons yelling at each other i have noticed some major changes in the way people are talking about their meme stocks since thursday • ⁠food stamps or lambos gme to the moon • ⁠do i die with nok or get cremated with nok • ⁠im holding amc until they make a movie about us all of these are hilarious but there is something deeper going on psychologically with these people and it is clear to me that they have changed from a finitemindset to an infinite mindset let me break it down when these players got robbed it instilled in them a righteous desire for justice im sure a bunch of them are familiar with the big short or were connected to the housing market crisis and theyre all aware of how these things happen at the expense of the common man and no one gets punished in their minds the only path forward now is to get revenge by putting the game back on its original path through their sheer force of will they will die playing this game and they cannot be reasoned or argued with maybe they still have a target price in mind but i need to be even more clear these infiniteminded players are working to get the other players to drop out and they are not leaving remember that vietnam war analogy i used earlier right now finiteminded players who only care about the target price of a meme stock are simply looking to win but the converted infiniteminded players are playing the long game and while they may have limited resources the vietnamese were completely outgunned and outnumbered you will only be able to these people from their position when they win 📈 what does this mean 📈 id be lying if i said i knew but i can wildly speculate for the rest of this post which i will do and you will listen the market is always trying to achieve equilibrium but what we are seeing is a motion to achieve rules equilibrium these players were cheated so they have created their own set of rules to play by buy and hold while these players may be small in number they are going to quietly drain the supply without anyone noticing the floor for these meme stocks is going to continue to rise and these players will continue to get people on board and things are going to snowball at some point they will attract the attention of people with real money who believe in their pursuit of justice and unlike the squeeze we started to see last week the supply and demand curve is going to be so out of whack you are going to see squeezes that will blow your 🦍 minds 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 even if these people lose they win 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 imagine for a moment that gme collapses to $ a share maybe the next quarter financials are abysmal do you think for a moment that these people arent going to be dumping every single dollar they have into it this will be like christmas to them because gme is not an investment in their minds its a ticket for their cause its the path to revenge what about if anything bad happens to dfv after hes pulled into a congressional hearing these people know that its not smart to storm the capital theyre attacking where it matters and theyre using their money some of these people saw what their position was at $ it was staring them in the face and it was going up they watched it plummet in real time can you imagine the level of conviction these people have do you think the hedge funds or even the other players have this level of steadfastness these people have diamond hearts ill say it again if someone with a lot of money is smart enough to notice all this the nuclear bomb of a broken supply and demand curve is going to explode making these infiniteminded players rich and demolishing those with weaker backbones we might lose a chunk of the market each time one of these nukes goes off personally i dont think were ever going back to $ for gme im shocked that its even close to $ right now but the truth of the matter is this the infiniteminded players have divorced meme stock price from the financials and it will be that way until we reach a point where the game resets to where it was on thursday this may take days weeks months or years to get there for some of the meme stocks but it doesnt matter because these people have invented their own rules and there are more players in that position than you or i think the media will eventually stop talking about these meme stocks assuming people have walked away but these people have found their cause and they will be committed to it until their wrong is righted and they are literally willing to die trying 💎🙌💀 please please please be aware of this the mindset of a large number of players has shifted almost overnight and they have chosen their battlefield none of their opponents are fighting the game at their level and throughout history when infiniteminded players have played an infinite game against finiteminded players the infiniteminded players have won they have won every single time thank you for coming to my ted talk tldr ape banana diamond hands rocket moon vietnam

lc6rgv,NOW,-9.17%,counterfeit shares and what we should be doing right now,Discussion,144,0.95,#NAME?,31,disclaimer the following is entirely a work of fiction created by a retarded and autistic monkey who was left to pound away on a keyboard for a few hours this monkey is neither a lawyer nor a financial advisor and the following is not to be construed as financial or legal advice i will start first by saying im new here but the shit ive seen the past few weeks has been mind blowing honestly i was annoyed at first that people were trying to coopt this into a direct battle with the hfs and later into some kind of class warfare instead of just an educated bet that might let us snag a few juicy tendies from some fuckwits who shoved their hands way too far into a tiny cookie jar ampxb past posts and a few nittygritty additions many of you have seen the dd done by ujohnnydaggers here you still okay bro as well as the information on this website if you havent read this yet fucking do it right now and read the whole thing nowim a skeptical as fuck autist i dont just believe anything at a glance and a lot of the information contained in the white paper “counterfeiting stock ” doesnt contain many links to the cited supporting documents or specific referencesand that troubles the autist half of my brain so i decided to at least spot check and zoom in on a detail that caught my eye ampxb zoom enhance see counterfeiting a stock part why does this continue to happen both houses of the utah legislature passed a bill that required daily disclosure of fails–to–deliver including identifying specific companies and the specific broker dealer positions in that company the bill also outlawed naked shorting of companies domiciled in utah the industry threatened litigation based upon federal preemption and backed the state down the bill was not signed into law in february the sec determined that the hedge fund industry did not require any additional regulation — they are virtually unregulated this may be the height of arrogance i searched for the specific bill the author mentioned in utah for those of you who dont know you can look up all laws proposed and passed at the local state and federal level they document all of this shit well i found it and read enough of it to satisfy my semi autistic brain for those of you who are less autistic than i am here are the most important parts summary narrowing of window to deliver securities to hours as well as provide detailed information about the transaction substantial penalties imposed on all parties responsible for a failure to deliver heres what the authors of the white paper got wrong though the bill passed almost unanimously and was signed into law however it was repealed later again with an overwhelming vote it seems they were bullied into doing this by sec and sifma securities industry and financial markets association this is the first time ive heard of this player in the game they are an advocacy group supporting the rights of the securities industry lol they are staffed mostly by big players in the banking and securities industry they are a “nonprofit” with a ceo who is compensated almost $ millionyear this number is from the ceo in i cant for the life of me find any info on salaries after that date so i can only assume that its higher now info from look at all of the cool things they are doing ampxb back to the selfincriminating sec doc if you havent yet look at this report below read the first pages at least its an executive summary published by sec about counterfeiting shares and the roll it played in the financial crisis of they know what is happening fucking read that report you fucking retarded autists its published by the sec and suggests that we might be buying counterfeit shares that are being conjured into existence right in front of our faces our strategy to buy and hold is probably the best thing we can do but we might be putting some money back in those fuckers pockets for them to reload we retail investors might own more shares than are even supposed to exist not counting what other institutions and other shareholders are supposed to have fucking reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee ampxb what does this mean if this is true and as pervasive in the system as all of this shit suggests they could be stealing billions if not fucking trillions of dollars every year at everyone elses expense when i say everyone i mean fucking everyone the entire world economy revolves around the us market the fraud here creates excess capital in the system that isnt backed by any real securities ie inflation your money is worth less when these fucks start counterfeiting shares ampxb explanation in retarded ape terms lets say you and your friends have 🍌 you each paid one 🍗 tendie for each 🍌 each 🍌 is still worth 🍗 and you can trade it in at any time well assume that the value stays constant doesnt really matter if the price goes up and down for this example as it obviously would in the stock market but uh oh here comes a 🐍 he made fake plastic 🍌 and he decides to sell them to you retarded apes you each pay him about one tendie for each fake 🍌 now there is a larger supply of 🍌 than there should be lets say in total that it cost you all 🍗 for all 🍌 due to the reduction in price caused by the surplus 🍌 in the system mr 🐍 slithers off with 🍗 you and your friends now have real 🍌 fake 🍌 and you paid whole 🍗 for them silly retarded apes oh and since you and your dumb fuck friends cant count at all andor lose count every days you have no fucking idea how many total 🍌 there are ampxb what else can we do besides staring at tickers and scrolling through memes so what do we do welli think the place to go now is to raise as much hell as we possibly can while we continue to 💎🖐️🖐️💎 we shouldnt just sit around waiting for the robinhood hearing fucking feb th my thought is that robinhood might just end up being the fall guy mostly a distraction from all of the other shit going on it may have even been legitimately out of rhs control to some extent vlad claimed that their clearing house suddenly demanded $ billion more from them in collateral leaving them scrambling meanwhile the hfs are still up to their dirty tricks all of the responsible parties need to be investigated and held accountable this could even include the nyse itself dtcc for either clearing fraudulent transactions or failing to resolve the ftds citadel melvin capital and sec hopefully this would be done by a committee completely independent from sec maybe it would even be the doj if the “counterfeit stock” theory is true and actually even if it is just good ol fashioned market manipulation then all of them at every level are complicit in this this isnt an isolated case as others have pointed outthey are all trying to cover their asses here to “protect the integrity of the entire marketplace and the interests of investors” translation fuck with it however they want in whatever way benefits them and maintain the status quo ampxb contact legislators and file complaints with everyone specific entities to contact or file complaints with file complaints with nyse sec for a paper trail if nothing else doj they may come into play if the sec is investigated they are also sometimes involved in investigations and prosecution related to the stock market see michael burry contact your state governments senators and congressmenwomen there were more than a few states that tried to close the loopholes which allow the market manipulation we are currently witnessing ampxb here is where you can find your senators and congressmenwomen youll need to just google to find your local state senators ampxb this comment is a great place to start for what to include in the email to your representatives remind them that they work for us you can also include a link to the sec report for their reading pleasure ampxb fucking reeeeee at the top of your lungs fellow retards and autists we need to let them know what we need and expect from them to our 💎🖐️🖐️💎 friends in every part of the world we need your help too i believe many countries in europe and countries throughout the world have systems in place which make ftds impossible trades are completed instantly between parties so a security has to be delivered their systems arent archaic retarded and easily exploited like ours join us in raising hell because this directly impacts you too your governments and the market infrastructures you have in place may give valuable data if we can get it contact your local governments and regulating bodies ampxb tldr first of all fuck you that monkey spent a few hours researching and compiling this shit specific details in “counterfeiting stock ” verified lends a little more credibility to it imo we might be fueling some of the hfs ability to keep going in this fight by purchasing their counterfeit shares but our best option is probably still to 💎🖐️🖐️💎 and buy

lc965q,None,N/A,s partners short interest miscalculation argument,Discussion,73,0.85,levaaa_,25,check out unov and his post on the s short interest numbers before reading typing on mobile so excuse shitty formatting essentially the argument is that there is an old and new short interest calculation used by s partners which is true i decided to look a little deeper into this an actually verify what he was saying these are the two equations as per s partners founders twitter old si sharesshort float new si sharesshort float sharesshort the new equation by adding the numerator to the base creates a asymptote in which means it is impossible to touch short interest and as a result is impossible to go above no real issue here unov claims however that the reason for the sudden drop in share short is that whatever analyst at s decided to take the short interest calculated from the new equation then use that to find shares short from the old equation this makes sense because because algebra would tell you that you cannot solve for two unknowns in an equation as simple as this no cube roots or quadratics or whatever this means that when we try and calculate shares short using the new equation we get this sharesshort si float sharesshort we cannot rearrange for sharesshort using valid algebra you could spend hours trying to but its not possible this here shows that in trying to calculate sharesshort we need the sharesshort variable which is already unknown you get the idea his idea is that with this an analyst then went onto use the old equation to recalculate the shares short sharesshort si float the issue with this is if we substitute si for the new equation we get this sharesshort sharesshortfloat shares short float you see the issue there is no way to calculate sharesshort without knowing short interest and the short interest cannot be calculated without knowing sharesshort neither calculation is feasible the logic is flawed the day in which these shorts were covered was the day we saw the second peak in price most of this peak was in post market in which institutional investors have full right to buy and sell shares and institutional investors are the one covering the shares not only this but unov needs to explain why ortex also showed a drop of the same size shares short i could have easily fucked up this math and an open to anyone correcting me but even so there is no explanation for ortex regardless there are still m shares sold short when we covered m shares there was a large price move which we may see the likes of again as we stay sitting at this $ support tldr misinformation but shouldnt matter because short interest still high as fuck,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc965q/s3_partners_short_interest_miscalculation_argument/,1612414800
lc9vdw,GME,71.37%,simple explanation of why im still holding shares of gme,YOLO,879,0.94,yamada517,95,i just join wsb last week and im happy to be with you retards on this journey as a fellow retard im not well versed the mechanical jargon of wall street i know enough to understand what is going on but ive always stayed away from shorting margin or options so honestly my smooth ape brain hurts reading about short ladder attacks itmotm contracts and naked shorts im sure the million new subscribers feel the same way so im going to break down in super simple terms why im still holding the stock first though its important to face reality this movement to take on the hedge funds has died down wsb was getting over million new subscribers per day and now its only gaining maybe subscribers the google trend data for gme stock shows significantly less traffic ampxb also a ton of paper handed fucks sold their positions and gave billions back to the hedge funds since there are less people joining and at lot of people who have sold out of gme there is a significantly less of a forced short squeeze but im still not selling why ill break it down with super simple math that even an ape can do according to yahoo finance there are million shares in the public float meaning shares available for the public to trade ampxb ampxb there are million subscribers on wsb if each subscriber held an average of shares wsb would control the entire float if the entire float was owned by wsb then wsb would literally control the price of the stock yes i know that not all million subscribers are going to buy gme and even if wsb did a lot of retards have paper hands and would sell early also many subscribers are just here to enjoy the show or are bots but lets pretend that just have diamond hands and buy gme that would mean there would be million people buying the stock if each bought an average of shares wsb would control the entire float million x million this is definitely possible although not probable given the recent developments however the risk vs reward is still very lucrative i created a probability table and assigned a probability of gme hitting certain prices ampxb according to my table i estimate that the probability that gme will go to $ or less at however in the event that wsb controls the shares of gme the price would skyrocket it doesnt matter if the short interest is at or there will be shorts that need to cover and there will be no supply i believe im being very conservative with my estimates on the upside i assign a chance that the price of the stock would go to $ or more out of the i only give a chance that the price will go to if you take all of the prices and assign a probability to each price you get a weighted average price of $ given the current price of $ that would represent a return to be clear i am in no way telling wsb to buy gme in order to gain control of the price im just saying if wsb happens to control it the upside will be significant if one were to get in at this price but what do i know im just a monkey ape retard idiot autist blah blah blah position gme $,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc9vdw/simple_explanation_of_why_im_still_holding_530/,1612414800

double my usual adderall dose this morning prescribed btw im ready to write my magnum opus obligatory disclaimer – this has nothing to do with gme im not encouraging anyone to divest their gme holdings this is a mediumterm play anyway so all you gme holders without extra cash can wait to see your short squeeze thesis play out and then come into this in a few weeks or whenever oblig disclaimer – this is not financial advice of any kind please do your own research i am not a financial advisor i do work in the us as a risk quant for a pension fund not a hedge fund but the fund does not invest in any of the below and i personally make no investment decisions hence being able to post this brief bit of infobackground on me – im a crossatlantic crossbreed ie an americanbritish kid years ago my dad went to the us on business and met my mom who was working as a cocktail waitress no she wasnt a stripper or working at hooters before you ask im also years old myself so draw your own conclusions about my backstory just keep them to yourself pls oh yeah as a kid a child psychologist diagnosed me as mildly on the spectrum for real but i think she was full of shit really other than that im a pretty boringordinary guy generally my investment thesis is anything but boring however moving on to the idea you dont care about me or my backstory anyway actually before then lets talk a bit about the uk or “england” as you americans always call it in movies im sure you guys think us brits all sit around in tweed coats drinking tea and acting like hugh grant or the cast of the crown but in reality the uk today is pretty americanised london anyway london is also the biggest financial centre in the world after new york our banks are up there with your big boys jpm citibank etc also oxford university rivaling harvard just invented a covid vaccine so onto the investment currently i have a significant amount of my portfolio in a x leveraged etf in the ftse index of the largest uk companies equivalent of your dow really as a british as well as american citizen i can trade this domestically on hargreaves lansdown but im sure you guys have access to various etfs that give you the same exposure wisdomtree for example despite the vaccine and strong recoveryquantitative easing the ftse is still down from its precovid peak in stark contrast to the dow or sampp which is at its alltime high so why is this good question – lets look at some of the biggest constituents of the ftse bp – remember these guys the villains from the deepwater horizon movie remember john malkovich in his bad southern drawl saying “we are a $bn company” well currently their market cap is $bn so theres huge potential upside yeah sure electric cars are coming along but in reality oil is going to be still needed for a helluva long time especially once air travel comes back plus oil is also used in plastics and pretty much every consumer material out there its going nowhere anytime soon royal dutch shell – same as above except they dont have a movie about them starring mark wahlberg hsbc – seventhlargest bank in the world up until recently their share price was the lowest its been since despite these guys making bucketloads of money in normal times also if hsbc ever go under that means the world financial system has basically ended so this investment not working out will be the least of your issues barclays – same as above except they dont have any issuesconcerns with being exposed to hong kongchina also their investment bank has been making out like bandits this year due to the volatility no idea why the share price is so low lloyds banking group – as above another autist made a good dd post on here about lbg recently look that up as the adderrall is wearing off so cant be arsed to repeat what he said iagbritish airways – huge airline thats obviously struggling right now but they have tons of cash and will definitely make it out of this crisis also down around from precovid highs unilever – the guys who make soap and washingup liquid everyone will always need these well maybe not the filthy autists on here like me astrazeneca – they just invented a highly effective covid vaccine enough said bhp – huge miner $bn valuation they are actually trading above their precovid highs but likely have more room to grow british american tobacco – the covid pandemic hasnt cured addiction people wont stop smoking anytime soon if anything it might go up as people are stressed by the pandemic the above are just a few the biggest examples of amazing value stocks in the ftse of course this is wsb not rinvesting so we need some additional risk thats why i would suggest a leveraged etf to amplify your returns disclaimer – leverage also amplifies your losses please dont invest money you cant afford to lose ok you say well what about the white elephant in the room ie brexit well this is wsb not rpolitics so i wont say that brexit was a monumentally stupid decision by our elected leaders but whilst brexit will undoubtedly cause pain for the uk economy as a whole the impact is mainly on smaller companies and businesses most of the constituents in the ftse are $bn companies for example banks are big enough that the legal expense of setting up a european entity is minimal so they still get unfettered access to the single european market so ftse companies shouldnt feel much pain from brexit in my opinion at least not enough to affect this thesis well what about the exodusbrain drain of finance and other professionals to europe you might ask well paris is nice but french labour laws mean you can basically never be fired or made to work late which doesnt really work for most big companies frankfurt is a strong contender to london… except its one of the most boring cities out there imagine moving from new york to fargo north dakota – except that everyone in fargo spoke a different language although judging from the tv show it seems like they may do anyway thats what it would be like for someone moving from london to frankfurt sorry germanyfargo ok so whats the risk level of this trade well tbh i would say the riskreward ratio is really good – with a leveraged etf you could conceivably make returns in the next few weeksmonths and thinking about it this is really almost riskfree – if the ftse tanks or stays low for the next year or two in reality that means were all still sheltering inside and now living in the monstrosity of a film that was michael bays “songbird” plotline – covid has mutated to be deadly and we are all still in lockdown in so at that point youll probably be scavenging for foodfocused on survival even if money still exists i can guarantee you wont be upset about any money you lost on this trade oh yeah also the ftse was down almost last month january so investment timing is also on your side if you go into this in the nearfuture autist out again pls do your own research this is all just my opinionautism tldr leveraged ftse etf is a great way to make returns over next few months with pretty low risk consists of huge oil companies investment banks that arent going anyway but still down from their peaks for no other reason than were britpoors if this goes tits up then were probably all still quarantined and living in michael bays songbird world in years time so money will be the least of your worries timing is on your side the ftse dropped last month for no discernible reason brexit is a risk but not that big an issue for these very large companies see above in the detail if you dont invest in this then you just dont like money gme holders dont need to panic as this is a mediumterm trade over a period of weeks or even months so plenty of time to hold your gme if you so

lchjnt,None,N/A,atlas air worldwide holdings aaww stock poised for breakout and is relatively unknown but certainty worth your time looking into with multiple catalysts for earnings this month,DD,21,0.82,Amurphy747,23,hello fellow autists i have an opportunity i wish to present to you that the company is atlas air aaww this article is an earnings play on a strong company that is not in mainstream media if you wanna get straight to the point just go to the end of this write up atlas air worldwide is a leader in global airfreight that serves freight commercial charter and military customers if you ever had an iphone or playstation or watched a san diego chargers game youve probably been impacted by atlas air they have a combination of an efficient fleet costsaving operations and superior customer service with nearly employees working across countries atlas air generated net sales of $ billion they provide acmi aircraft crew maintenance and insurance whereby they provide outsourced cargo and passenger aircraft operating solutions including the provision of an aircraft crew maintenance and insurance while customers assume fuel demand and price risk in addition customers are generally responsible for landing navigation and most other operational fees and costs ampxb ampxb flying our tendies as you read this the company recently strengthened and diversified its business and fleet with a focus on serving express and ecommerce which has positioned it well to handle the increased demand in online orders and the future distribution of vaccines  in the third quarter management saw strong demand for their longhaul widebody services the company anticipates solid volumes in the fourth quarter driven by continued ecommerce growth they recently made a deal with alibaba baba to send their consumers merchandise to south america and allowing them to grow operations there the stock has a forward pe ratio of this compares to its industrys average forward pe of their biggest competitor is air transport services group atsg who even though has a bigger market cap higher pe ratio of also happens to have a smaller fleet then atlas air and does not have the which is the newest model of the and most fuel efficient while carrying more weight which in this industry is crucial and helps them stand out from their competitors they just bought more s to add to their fleet a resistance level has formed in the chart of atlas air worldwide holdings inc  if this level is crossed a breakout could occur and has been at the same levels since november aaww saw strong earnings and revenue growth in the third quarter with earnings up year over year and revenue up the stock is trading at a low valuation with a price to sales ratio of and a price to book ratio of the companys cash position for the third quarter was $ million up from $ million in the same quarter last year though that is considerably lower than its longterm debt of $ billion aaww has shown strong longterm momentum but is down over the shortterm there are multiple catalysts that could cause this stock to break out the first one is the fact that the company is being apart of the vaccine distribution and is expected for the next year to help distribute the vaccine because their aircraft can support and hold the refrigerators to carry the vaccines since they have to be kept cold second catalyst atlas air has a partnership with amazon where amazon leases their fleet to transport all their shit all over the world with the epidemic and amazon growing like crazy this has only lead atlas air to grow amazon has warrants to buy up to of the company by end of and its christmas and i have a feeling christmas records for amazon are about to be shattered which means atlas air will be busy also typically around christmas through february is the companys busiest time of the year even without third catalyst growth atlas air is adding to its fleet just bought more s and is hiring more pilots to tackle the tasks at hand also passenger airlines typically when doing international trips hold additional cargo in their hull to make more profits but with less international flights due to covid atlas air has had growth in customers asking them to hull freight and assuming atlas air does good with these customers and makes them happy their clientele should expect to grow forth catalyst gasoline is pretty cheap even though it is rising in price with vaccine news it is still much cheaper then previously before for aircraft fifth catalyst maybe as the coronavirus chaos is beginning to come to an end and super sexy overvalued tech companies are no longer as attractive this can lead to an emphasis on value and funds will be longer for their next growth prospects and this provides opportunity for value and growth and a way to capitalize off the coronavirus vaccine amazon holiday season and a ever changing world sixth catalyst if you go into long term callsevery time there is a war atlas air booms because the military hires them to fly out to the middle east and shit is stirring up in the middle east right now passenger airlines are responsible for of air freight before covidimagine what the earnings report will look like after this busy holiday season to summarize this is a well ran growing company and the stock price is poised for a breakout with a combination of these catalysts the company is no where near its all time high yet it is the best it has ever been financially the company is also owned over by institutional investors so there is lots of smart money in the company who recognize value and the next earnings report is this month on the th and this company tends to have a run up towards earnings literally cant go tits up 🚀🚀✈️✈️🌚🌚 dont roast my shit

lc8vgo,SLV,-6.10%,$slv is not going to get squeezed$slv is the trojan horse for the squeeze thats already happening,DD,683,0.89,jobead,193,i have no horse in the gme fight right now i wish you all the best and it is the biggest trading mistake of my life so far i was talking about gme with my friends in march and even did trade some options then for a loss i must have read dfv at some point as we were discussing burry and a technical short squeeze happening but i missed the real boat so good on dfv and all of the rest of you degenerates instead i focused my market attention during quarantine on precious metals my opinion is that in the long term years they will provide the only real hedge against inflation in the world as every cb on the planet is exploding the supply of fiat to deal with covid economic disruption in the short term i believe that the powers that be are engineering the largest short squeeze in the history of markets we do not have the power to effect whether this happens it is simply an inevitability hfs banks and other large institutions are going to extract an enormous amount of wealth from the world during this squeeze this money will be taken from the future pocket of every consumer of industrial goods for the next several decades in the form of inflated prices on everything batteries electronics solar panels evseven jewelry and silverware we cannot stop them but i have decided to try to hop on for the ride the last few months aside i never saw wsb as a force for societal change because the people who control the money are always going to win the most in the end wsb is a place where we can learn the tricks of a market that is structurally rigged against us and use those tricks to our advantage to use an analogy that i think we all know i am not and will never be ender but i can learn that the enemys gate is down and play the game that way the tldr is this the market for silver is the most manipulated physical market in the history of the world $slv is the vehicle that is currently being used behind the scenes to vaccum up ownership of every available physical bar of silver in major bullion vaults in the world when it has completed doing that the paper markets that have held down the price of silver for decades will become disconnected from the physical markets the energy that has been artificially held back for decades by this paper will explode the price of physical silver and i have no idea how high it will go $slv will stand mostly alone as the worlds exchange traded product for electronic trading of physical silver lets start at the beginning why is silver important silver has been used as real currency for thousands of years and there is an argument to be made for returning to sound money through the use of silver and gold however that is not the argument that i am making silver is a highly industrial metal and its usage for industry will only continue to expand as we electrify the future silver is important for electrical applications bc it is the mostconductive leastresistive metal in the universe it is used heavily in all electronic applications even more since rohs has pushed us away from tinlead and towards tinsilver solder blends with silver being added to mitigate the longevity problems of tin solder growing tin whiskers and shorting out components but the largest new demands on silver are going to come from solar panels and evs utilityscale solar is now virtually tied with wind as the cheapest new sources of energy in the world and is only getting cheaper every year as fossil fuel plants continue to reach the end of their service life they are going to be replaced with solar and wind technologies as evs become more prevalent their components especially their batteries will produce additional demand for silver as smart investors are wont to do this coming demand for industrial silver has been frontrun and large quantites of silver have been sucked into investment products so that they can produce financial returns when demand begins to increase showed remarkable investor interest in silver to the tune of an estimated mtoz moving into exchange traded products like $slv $slv alone added mtoz of silver to its holdings in unfortunately for the market supply cannot meet demand of the mtoz estimated for demand only mtoz was available for physical investment because the rest was consumed by industrial uses this means that $slv alone absorbed almost the entire worlds capacity for silver investment in and as youll see soon this is only accelerating in source for demandsupplyinvestment numbers lets get physical physical now its important to understand that huge amounts of silver is traded on paper markets and these markets have historically decided the approximate cost of physical silver in the world in the form of the spot price im not going to give anyone a primer on how this works go read about the london fix and comex paper on your own time but the important thing to know is that there are a bunch of silver bars in vaults in london and in the us and electronic claims on them are traded on the lbma and comex continuously without the silver ever leaving the vaults however these vaults have concrete numbers of physical bars in them and trading contracts against them technically means that you can show up at a window somewhere and demand your x oz bars that a comex warrant entitle you to this redemption happens all the time and it can be used to extract physical silver from the unallocated storage at bullion vaults and release it to industrial or consumer bullion uses however these bars can also be moved into registered or allocated accounts without them leaving the overall vault storage this means that a quantity of individual silver bars that an owner holds title to can be physically moved inside the vault onto a different rack and the owner has individual serial numbers of bars that they own these bars can be withdrawn on demand only by their owner and are not available for general redemption of a comex warrant so how many bars are there well between lbma and comex there are mtoz sitting in vaults sources below when i start doing math this includes all allocated and unallocated bars now obviously london and ny are separated by an ocean but people always like to bring up that bars could be moved bw london ltgt american comex vaults this is an enormous undertaking but lets make a spherical chicken in a vaccuum level assumption and say that lbma comex vaults are a singular source of inventory for both $slv and other market participants if you read the $slv s which i did you would learn that the custodian of the $slv trust is required to hold all silver weight with an exception for toz of unallocated lol that is owned by the trust in allocated accounts where the individual bars are physically segregated inside the vaults and the serial numbers of the owned bars are explicitly recorded the idea that there is no physical silver backing the slv trust and you could get settled with cash is ridiculous ishares publishes a report listing every serial number of every bar that is owned by the trust along with the total weight contained in the bars it is pages long you can read it here if you have trouble sleeping at night and is updated frequently the underlying silver is owned by the trust it cannot be removed from the trust unless baskets of shares are redeemed by an authorized participant which is only a few large brokers it cannot be removed by the bullion vaults and given to other customers because it is physically segregated inside the vaults people who have recently beaten down the idea of a silver squeeze love to talk about how jp morgan is the custodian for the slv trust and because jpm just paid a $b fine for historical manipulation of the paper silver market they arent going to be honest about this this is crazy talk when it comes to the dishonesty of a big bank there is fraud and there is fraud fraud would be them saying oh sorry we didnt realize that a laundromat bringing in $kweek of dirty dollar bills was out of the ordinary fraud happens all the time and the banks get away with it regularly fraud would be them saying oh yes rd party customer ishares who services dozens of other large banking institutions in the world here is objective evidence with serial numbers that we have these silver bars in the vault and then just making up the data it is qanonlevel crazy imho to think that jpm is going to commit fraud by publishing a list of serial numbers that is completely fake i believe the exact opposite since they have just gotten caught they are playing it straight this time and have just switched sides in order to go long on the comex alone jp morgan chase is long mtoz or just north of $b comex depository data by weight the problem for the futures and options markets is that their continual trading of paper contracts is chasing a smaller and smaller amount of physical silver that is not owned by $slv and the market participants minus now jpm who have gotten away with naked selling of paper contracts and mostly settling them for cash are going to soon find the underlying vaults empty and no metal to give to warrant holders who come looking for it how big of a problem is $slv for the naked shorts in the paper market lets do some math $slv inventory math $slv is holding troy ounces in trust and has shares outstanding if you are curious why $slvshare trades below the spot price its because mtoz m shares toz share $slv data from here screenshot from tonight for posterity bullion vault inventory math london lbma silver stocks are mtoz us comex silver stocks are mtoz of the vaulted silver in the world is already owned by slv subtracting what slv already owns leaves us with mtoz this is completely ignoring the fact that a lot of that remaining silver is owned in registered or allocated accounts by individual owners eg there is mtoz in registered on the comex which means those bars are already specifically deeded to an individual owner but they could theoretically sell it to slv so i included it as available mtoz is the absolute theoretical maximum available in lbma comex silver that is not already owned by slv now how short are the shorts some more math oi on comex futures toz toz toz toz mtoz in currently open interest that could be demanded for delivery just on the comex there could be demand for twice as much silver as there is in the combined lbma comex vaults that is not explicitly owned by $slv right now caveats i have not included any london futures contracts that may have claims on metal here i am not versed in their contracts at all and dont have a good data source right now if anyone knows how to calculate the short obligation for london i would be glad to add it i have not analyzed any of the strike prices on comex options or dates on comex futuressome of them could be way out of the money or way in the future many silver producers sell futures years in advance to lock in prices and then deliver the physical to satisfy the contracts using the same basic methodology–total shorts divided by shares toz in this case outstanding–as is used on a stock to calculate short interest and gave us the infamous short interest on gme we getdrumroll please short physical short interest open interest on comex silver futures and options is equivalent to a short interest against all london and us available inventory but it gets even worse wanna add a gamma squeeze i pulled the data for all current oi in slv options there is a large number million of call contracts open here are the totals using the tozshare number we can calculate that there are up to mtoz that would have to be bought during an absolute runaway gamma squeeze call options on $slv max out right now at $ so the spot price would only have to increase by around to reach the point that all of that weight would need to have been purchased but at some point it could become selfreinforcing and the gamma squeeze continues to cause more gamma squeezing i believe that this almost happened sunday evening as evidenced by the huge premium that $slv was trading to the futures price for a few minutes when trading opened my comparison chart the silver etf that trades on sunday in tel aviv closed up gt and was consistenly rising for the entire session before any american spot markets opened i believe that hedging algorithms at mm firms that write options saw this spike as a need to buy shares in $slv to cover their deltas and so they bought the opening of $slv like crazy $slv opened up while paper only opened up about paper market players had to sell mtoz of paper in the first minute of trading to keep the price under control i have never seen an imbalance like this before and it was covered up quickly within hours of trading but to me it sounds like vincents heartbeat monitor in gattaca when he runs out of fake signal there was a cover up required to hide this explosion when the day comes that this cover up is not executed properly stuff is going to get ugly bc $slv wont just gamma squeeze like a normal stock but wait theres more a traditional gammashort squeeze will seem like nothing in silver the squeeze in silver will be far worse than the combination of a gamma and short squeeze in a stock because shares of stock cannot be removed from the market eventually somebody holding $vw or $gme is going to say sure ill sell at $ per share and that share can go back to cover a short but if instead of doing that the holder of that share withdrew it from the market by converting it to a physical token bc they thought that the physical token would be more valuable than the share the retail premium on physical silver vs paper silver the short interest would increase as shares were converted into tokens and since there are currently more shares of silver than there are bars of silver in the vault the shorts can be caught with a literally illiquid market that has nothing to buy zero zilch no silver available the doomsday scenario for paper silver holders and writers is the following combination holders of comex warrants will see the rising premium of physical bullion to the spot price and decide to redeem their warrants for physical a rising spot price will gamma squeeze the writers of $slv options into buying more shares in a runaway fashion and the trust will absorb all available vault inventory as it issues new shares comex warrant holders who try to demand metal that doesnt exist will literally break the market the cboe will probably step in and decide to force settle the contracts for cash at the last known good price and comex paper warrants will cease trading forever the physical market price will then be disconnected from the paper market and $slv as an exchange traded product will stand mostly alone as the new paper market for silver so wtf do i do not financial advice well i could always buy physical silver if i can stomach the premium and wait weeks for it to show up or i could just get long on $slv since i believe that $slv will stand alone after the dust settles as the one true claim on bars in the vaults i could be long the actual $slv ticker in several ways buying shares duh but it worked for $gme buying long dated calls gamma squeeze go brrrrr but who knows when buying option spreads my personal favorite if i wanted to maximize my contribution to the gamma squeeze id probably buy as much delta$ as i could get using weeklies which would be $c or $c max delta$ calculations and current open positions for me are jan call spread costs moonshot pays $ x call spread costs moonshot pays $ x $ call to maximize delta$ jan $ call to minimize risk of missing the big one $ag shares and jan call spread added sorry i forgot this one footnote all the pictures i think i used in case i missed

lcibx9,GME,71.37%,truth about holding gme,Discussion,17,0.59,Davidjaa,20,first of all i respect everyone who is holding and this post will be probably downvoted but at least i try to make clear my mind weve seen many people saying that the price drop is due to short ladder attacks while this has never been proven and some actual dd shows that it does not exist i do believe that people say i hold but are selling in stead or have sold their position already i do remember the days that you will get banned for not showing your position now all i see is non dd rather discussions that are actually shit posts and people like that because they like the sensation you can hold but the ship will go down before the squeeze i think most short are covered by many i mean in januari the stock went up for almost thats not normal also i do believe many have bought short position when it was sky high makes them a good amount of money right now it has very high volume past week which could be enough to close many short positions from a low price lets say short interest was at a price of $ and they closed down and reopened new positions at a price of $ that means that even short interest is high this time it will not help on our side hold if you can afford like mark cuban said in his ama also remember that he was talking about general tactics not just about gme the price has been dropped pretty hard and i feel bad for people who got in with a high average price holding the stock doesnt make you feel you lost money it still can go up but when and if thats the big question even with the less restrictions from robinhood which you shouldve dropped already the stock seems to have less activities but the stock still drops as for now i hope for all that the stock goes back up also a note to hold this to an empty bag does not harm hedge funds theyre doing this kind of bets all the time sometimes it pays out sometimes it doesnt only difference right now is that we as retailer traders are a part of it i bet they got a new stock already to short its almost impossible to destroy a hedge fund as shown in the crisis take a note of the sec too they do know some shit isnt right and yet theyre protecting the hf why they deliver more money than we do this are just my thought about the whole situation i hope that i am wrong time will tell till then i cant wait to watch the movie about this epic moment,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcibx9/truth_about_holding_gme/,1612414800

lcs4np,GME,71.37%,gme from the viewpoint of the average bag holder,Discussion,36,0.88,-random--user-,10,gme the voice of an average bag holder hey guys i dont usually post things in this subreddit i became a member back in september when i first started using rh and messing around with tesla and stuff i stayed on over the months and generally looked at the posts as a way of learning things here or there eventually i got frustrated that i didnt understand puts and calls and options and all that and i left the subreddit then last wednesday i woke up and checked the news to see gme skyrocketing in what i like to call “prepremarket”the time before rh opens up premarket i quickly put some pjs on and ran to the kitchen to tell my roommates to invest i got in quick and made a few hundred dollars i sold and went about the day buying and selling a few times then i started reading this sub again seeing all the wonderful things people were saying i felt alienated from this group for so long but i told myself this was finally an opportunity to fit in i could take part in the gme to the moon posts and diamond hands pictures so i woke up early thursday to buy only to see the news from rh i went to bed worried what if i missed the big squeeze that night i had a restless night i had dream after dream that gme had hit $ before i could buy back in i dreamt that i missed out on it all because i wasnt willing to have patience i woke up and saw the price at $ and was thankful i hadnt missed the rocket i bought a few shares with my savings all in good hopes that it would prove to be a catalyst in finally getting a car college is hard without one the day went on and the stock lowered and lowered and lowered over the weekend i was a little worried nothing i couldnt handle i was so excited for the “rocket” then monday hit and my friends all sold i made fun of them and called them “traitors” and “paper hands” then tuesday hit and they were the ones laughing at me then wednesday and now today my savings are drying up and theres not much to show for it when this is all over i dont think ill ever go into investing again ive been thinking for days trying to cope with it i know it wasnt much people have lost much more than me a kid but it was my money i earned it working and sweating and it was mine but the point of this isnt to be depressing its to cope and help others who might be in similar positions this isnt over yes ive looked at the data and done my research and read my fair share of plans but thats not what im talking about when i get worried i feel a peace that it will all be alright there are many people experiencing the same thing as you right now theres still a chance that melvin needs to cover its shorts and the squeeze could still happen and if not gme has plenty of new allies to help it recover and become a strong pick in the future and holding will help them im okay because i know what mark cuban said he said only to sell if the reason you bought has been broken or proved wrong but i bought this stock because i wanted to be part of something bigger i bought this stock because i wanted to do my part against corruption and greed and missing out on a car is hard i know but i made that decision and if i dont own up to it ill be miserable and blaming everyone else for years we can do this no matter what happens,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcs4np/gme_from_the_viewpoint_of_the_average_bag_holder/,1612414800

lcfm96,GME,71.37%,silver shiny me likey read disclaimer b downvote gme gang,DD,24,0.69,Prestigious_West_524,13,this post is about physical silver not the etfs or futures contracts hello sec thank you for reading my due diligence on silver please note i am not inciting a short squeeze im just telling people that i like slv and why they should consider liking it too i am not a financial advisor and we are all individuals acting of our own accord if you want someone to investigate try investigating the hedge funds and corrupt brokers ampxb before gme gang downvotes listen up this isnt rgme this is rwallstreetbets i know you have your battles to buy but we shouldnt miss out on slv just because you guys like gme still of course dont sell gme to buy slv just hold and wait for the squeeze but we must recognise that slv is actually a legit play ampxb if you want to check that im not a robot send me captchas and ill do them for you ampxb recently there have been a few posts about slv but i tried to wait until the gme hypes has died down to post this this dd will be split into two parts why slv in on itself is a good and safe investment boomer dd why slv has moon mission potential wsb dd we should not miss the silver play just because we are currently in gme you guys may not know this but its actually possible to hold more than one type of stock at the same time the boomer dd source goldsilvercom why silver is a good investment silver cannot be created out of thin air it cannot be printed silver has no counterparty risk physical silver does not rely on another party making good on their contract silver also outperforms gold in bull markets ampxb gold vs silver government inventories of silver are also falling since silver does have industrial uses in the future these industrial demands will be difficult to meet this is because governments no longer hold large stockpiles of silver due to the fact that they no longer need the silver to make coins ampxb ampxb silver use in industrial production is also increasing there is silver in cell phones things like self heating windshields as a catalyst for the production of plastics and chemicals etc one key use of silver is its use in photovoltaic cells which is the main constituent of solar panels so silver is also a solar energy play with biden taking office we can expect more production of solar panels and thus an increase in demand for silver that governments cannot fulfil photovoltaic cells are those little tiny cells that you see on solar panels read more about it here on average a solar panel uses about grams of silver ampxb china needs silver but cant get it silver supply is dropping silver prices crashed after it peaked in as silver dropped silver miners had to find ways to cut costs to keep turning profit what they did was they dramatically decreased the amount of exploration and development for silver mines as such silver production is in decline ampxb chart for you ampxb so to conclude the boomer dd inflation is on the rise too much money is being printed silver outperforms gold silver biggest use is industrial use silver demand is increasing silver supply is dropping wsb dd 🚀🚀🚀🚀 ampxb according to coingapecom in order to pull short squeeze of hedge funds not necessarily jp morgan we would need silver to go to $ ampxb ampxb some tweet they put on their site idk 🚀🚀 ampxb of course i am in no way saying that we should short squeeze silver hello sec im just saying that i really like slv stock and you should consider it for the above boomer reasons there is also an additional upside of the fact that if for some reason many people bought the stock it would squeeze upwards infinitely this is because unlike the gme short squeeze where gme can issue new stock a silver short squeeze could continue until they manage to mine more silver because silver cannot be printed also we saw a lot of hedge funds trying to interfere with the gme short squeeze robinhood restricting bought gme shares brokers being gay etc etc the difference with silver is brokers do not control how much silver we can buy and all the new people who just joined wsb in the daily discussion thread going hey guys im a newbie can someone please tell me whether stocks are going up or down today and also how can i buy stock also which stock is going up the most today thank you can also join in if a short squeeze were to happen this is how it would happen people buy slv stock not random etfs because they dont buy physical silver silver price go up jp morgan angry robinhood and other brokers experience temporary outages buy button glitch where buy button disappears for some reason limiting slv shares that can be bought wsb and noobs who dont know how to buy stock can just go outside and buy physical silver bars or coins or since we are in a pandemic order it off ebay or something basically the special thing about silver is that more cannot be printed and that buying it cant be restricted in any meaningful way whether or not large banks like jp morgan are actually short silver is a different discussion that other people should write about because its heavily debated and i dont know the answer but what we can confirm is that hedge funds are short on silver maybe in the future first place will get a silver medal and second place will get gold ampxb rebuttals against the bullish case on silver i have been drafting this message for a while and at the same time have skimmed a few antisilver posts the common points against this is one contract is too expensive people who dont know how to trade futures will get stuck with it its taking attention away from gme ampxb one contract is too expensive the contracts you are referring to are the futures aka paper silver there are three ways to buy physical silver but silver futures and take delivery buy slv shares buy silver from jewellers or online sellers there are currently around times more contracts for silver in the comex markets than there is supply of it this means that when you buy slv futures and exercise it the person who sold it to you would have to scramble to find someone who does have it once we do this they will start to realise and register to complete lack of silver there is in the market companies like tsla samsung and canadian solar have been accumulating a silver stockpile because they know that supply is dwindling people have bought all the reasonably priced silver online too if you dont believe me check for yourself ampxb people who dont know how to trade futures will get stuck with tonnes of silver and delivery fees see above ampxb its taking attention away from gme i am not being paid by anyone to write this i just genuinely see the potential for it while i do agree that gme is still relevant it doesnt mean we cannot have other stocks in our portfolios we shouldnt miss out on silver just because we are still in gme besides a slv squeeze would be much more beneficial than the gme squeeze because of my last point below ampxb ampxb last and most important point the benefit of a silver price rise when gme prices go up who benefits shareholders hedge funds who are long gme banks etc when bitcoin moons who benefits banks rich people people who have the education and means to figure out how to buy it people who have access to bitcoin wallets brokers etc when we blow up stocks like gme and btc even though we profit and even if we bankrupt hedge funds the money goes to other hedge funds or rich people who can afford the risk to own gme stock ampxb but who owns silver almost every household owns some silver whether its bars coins or religious statues poorer countries and places like asia and africa most households have a small silver chain a family heirloom ornamental utensils or ornamental gourd bucket i dont know if silver prices moon money goes to the people even though yes some will go to rich people who are long on silver silver is something that poor people are also shareholders of if we can get silver back to its fair value through the reasons and hypothetical methods i mentioned above we can not only burn hedge funds profit for ourselves but also help poor families poor people dont how to set up a brokerage account and buy gamestonk poor people dont know how to trade cryptocurrencies poor people dont have the capital to enter into the stock market what they do have is gold and silver mainly silver when they dont have the knowledge or ability to buy shares as proven with the recent influx of people with what is a broker kind of questions they get left out of these massive wealth transfers its much easier to say buy silver lol than ok so open a brokerage account with a broker that does not block meme stocks and that suits your needs verify all your information deposit money and make sure the risk you take aligns with your risk tolerance and the amount you are willing to lose if you want to bankrupt hedge funds dont transfer wealth from one hedge fund to other hedge funds who are long gme instead transfer wealth from the hedge funds to the pockets of poor families tldr wsb dd if silver goes back to its fair value then lots of poorer people will benefit from this along with you also silver buying cannot be restricted because you dont need a broker to buy silver if you are reading this ditch robinhood and change brokers if you dont change brokrs they will keep doing things like this when you dont pay for a product you are the product regardless or whether or not we take part silver will get to its fair value although it would be faster if we joined ampxb stocks i like slv stocks i do not like silver etfs that have paper silver positions if you have questions counterpoints suggestions or edits

lcrykd,GME,71.37%,why i liquidated all my gme holdings at an loss to go all in on amc,DD,41,0.67,jaamr15,20,i will start this dd by saying to those still holding gme your awesome and i cheer your successes with it and support you in your losses i know that many of you bought the stock bc you truly like the company and i honestly believe ryan cohen and his new pals will turn the ship around for gamestop although believe that will take some time i will try to keep this brief for all the apes autists here but even yolo plays should have some level of reason to them maybe tldr version gme is better positioned for a ss but amc will likely benefit amc is better fundamentally positioned as the economy reopens and consumers migrate from video games to getting out and socializing at the movies amc prepandemic was around $ $ supporting the current buy point although it may go lower as gme drags lower amc took advantage of its rising stock price to eliminate some of its debt whales believe in its potential too dave portney bought $k worth of amc yesterday as of s shows shares float short interest against amc m out of m vs of gme m out of m float this isnt public i had to pay for this short interest is one thing but lets compare that to daily volume the average volume is m for gme and m for amc amc goes through of its float shares a day and gme goes through of its float across the day average this makes the short ratio or days to cover at for gme and for amc which means that if a ss were to happen it will more than likely happen for gme as the short positions on amc could quickly be covered without causing much craziness however amcs swings is heavily correlated to gme see below ampxb price swing between amc vs gme across short squeeze ampxb while correlation is not causation its likely that during a gme ss this will greatly impact amc furthermore the amc has not crashed as much as gme either having now overtaken it today in the upward direction as gme continues to slide down amidst restrictions and scrutiny all of the people that had x profit of their investment will began to recognize more and more how heavy 💎🙌 can be causing more selloff reducing the impact of a ss eg if it falls to $ i dont think ss could take it above $ i previously wrote a dd about how gme could be fundamentally worth $ i think that will take quite a bit of time in reinventing the company whereas amc will benefit much more quickly than gamestop in the shortterm as the economy reopens people will be running away from video games to getting out and going to watch movies the prepandemic price of amc was $ which means that at the very least if it goes down by a lot more it is likely to return to this level as the economy reopens in other words amc is on discount right now while gme will continue to be on discount for a while and continually increasing its discount percentage so you could make profits on amc and then get gme for an even greater discount than currently longterm i think amc will continue to struggle as distribution companies look to release films through streaming platforms but for now as economic restrictions continue to lift and more people feel safer about getting out and about amc is primed for vast shortterm success 🚀🚀🚀🚀 fundamentally this is safer than holding out for a gme ss and still benefits from a gme ss as well as of q amc has a debttoasset ratio of vs gme debttoasset ratio of however amc didnt start opening up theaters until aug which is days closed out of days of the quarter eg they were open for less than half of the quarter while continuing to pay for benefits to all of its employees this bleeds through cash like a bullet wound to the aorta as opposed to gamestop they were able to open many of its stores earlier in q with ecommerce growth and continued q debttoasset increase that said for q many of amcs theaters were open being able to start earning revenue and not just bleeding money qs eps estimate for amc is $ eps vs q $ i actually believe it wont be as low and could be as high as $ eps the last year amc was profitable was as people spend more time streaming movies than going to the movies but the forecasted trend is still positive for amc the major weight on a companys ability to overcome obstacles such as a global pandemic is having to take on debt debt can open lots of opportunities but if its a means to survive rather than grow it really creates a burden this is where amc made a great move in my opinion over gme with converting its debt to shares eliminating $m worth of debt while it has diluted the shares and would have diluted gme shares too reducing ss potential it enhances the ability of the company to grow reducing that burden of debt finally dave portney who said he was exiting all the meme stocks has went back into amc by $k 🚀🚀🚀🚀my price target for amc is $ within the year 🚀🚀🚀🚀 its been there before and with bentup demand it has a lot more to gain than hoping for a gme ss amc is

lchy5p,None,N/A,why should i buy the dip,Discussion,57,0.76,Imateacher3,43,i see people commenting “buy the dip” all the time but why would i buy the dip on a stock that dropped what if im not confident that the stock will rebound that is exactly why buying the dip is helpful at first it might seem you should buy the dip simply because the stock is cheaper so it makes sense to buy at a lower price of course thats true but theres more to it than that buying at a lower price will bring down your average cost per share its possible to bring it down so much that you can recover out of a massive loss this is also why you should never go “all in” on a stock that is being hyped heres an exampleif i buy shares at $share then i need to sell $ to break even but if i buy more shares $ now i have shares that cost $k or $share now to break even i need the stock to jump back to $ and not $ if you go all in then you have no money left to buy the dip if you can scrounge together so more cash you can buy your average share down but if you only spent of what you were willing to invest then you could buy yourself into a profitable situation again consider you bought shares $ the stock drops to $ and you buy more shares now the average cost for your shares $ a much more manageable goal to reach if you continue to buy the dip long term or if you have the capital to buy enough shares then you can bring down the average cost per share to a point where you could cash out of the stock jumps even a few percentage points tldr never go “all in” buy the dip drive down you average cost per share,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lchy5p/why_should_i_buy_the_dip/,1612414800

sure a lot of us had a few options and made a killing off those but the majority of the money made on gme was in shares obviously the short squeeze potential drove that more than anything but i think its important to look at why else it worked gme brought in a lot of new investors who know nothing about the market i bet of people dont know how to buy options or how they work but anyone can buy shares and buying shares probably saved a ton of us from buying fds and blowing up our accounts early so when gme was initially surging from $ to $ we kept buying shares instead of going for the home run i think thats something to keep in mind on any future plays we all love our options but shares were key to this for more than just the squeeze we moved the market gamestop was obviously the big one but amc and express were saved from bankruptcy we brought attention to blackberry which just needed a little bump and is a legitimate company thats really cool i love gamestop and going to the movies and im glad were not seeing more companies go under due to the virus we didnt do this all on our own though what we provided was that initial spark once the big guys saw what we were doing they piled on thats a good thing it means they saw the same things we did just not as early we have the worlds attention we dominated the world and financial news for about a week they made jokes about us on snl your grandparents know what wallstreetbets is now a chat room right the white house was monitoring the situation the whole world is now watching and waiting for us to decide which stock is the next big play even the worst dd posts now could send a stock skyrocketing because people will have severe fomo from gme and the others all because we liked a stock and decided to buy it cool the bad we pissed people off now we do this all the time but its usually limited to each other and the real world never knows about it we pissed off short sellers hedge funds the media analysts and the sec you may think who cares fuck em and i agree to an extent but together they have the power to prevent us from doing anything like this ever again oh and they all lied about us the stock everything everyone so expect that to continue people lost big i know we love our loss porn but there were people buyingin for the first time at like $share anyone doing this was taking enormous risk especially when a lot of us got in when the price was in the teens and averaged up to the $s if this was you you learned an expensive lesson dont chase the ugly hivemind got the best of us at some point around $share we shouldve all taken a look at where we were at and reassessed im not blaming because im guilty of it too we downvoted anyone who questioned why we werent taking profits or had legitimate concerns about numbers that were coming out thats a real problem and when the information started to turn against us eg the s short interest report we shouldve known it was time to get out even if it was false there were enough red flags by that point this started out as a sure thing shorted shorts extremely underwater losing $ etc once that narrative started to shift we risked the stock price tanking new dd will be a mess seriously take any new dd with a fucking gulp of salt because the pumpers are coming we made millions off of gme and theres no doubt someone is out there just salivating at the thought of pumping up a shitty company in order to profit now more than ever its extremely important for you to pay attention to a posters history and really do your own research on a company if youre not comfortable holding shares for a long time then dont buy the stock i personally loved gmes potential even without a short squeeze due to their management and vision my plan has always been to ride the squeeze to the top then buy back in and hold it for years nothing about that has changed oh and do you want to know what the next short squeeze will be ill tell you right now none there are no more short squeeze opportunities so stop fucking looking for them if you see a post about the next short squeeze just move on its not happening period you think things were bad before just you wait takeaways the biggest takeaway for me has been how people changed their tactics when it came to gme in particular buying shares was key that was the game changer additionally people with legitimate concerns with evidence to back them up should at least be heard its one thing to downvote a shitpost quite another to laugh at someone for suggesting there might be something were all missing remember when people laughed at dfv sometimes its good to listen to contrary opinions oh on an unrelated note gme shares are approaching my personal rebuy price of around $share this is what i believe the stocks fair value is without any potential short squeeze with ryan cohens leadership i think this company will have a nice turnaround i wouldnt be surprised to see it legitimately trading at around $$share in the next year or so not a recommendation to buy i just love this stock 🚀,2021-02-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lclwx5/gme_what_did_we_learn/,1612414800

lglrg5,GME,163.93%,naked shorting in gme and how the pieces suddenly fit together,DD,1912,0.96,rainforest11,1729,tldr hard to distill it into tldr but essentially a lot of pieces clicking together if you believe there was naked shorting in gme and there is strong evidence to support that theory i know ape cant read but i implore you to read the whole thing i was doing some research on naked shorting in the context of gme which led me down a rabbit hole of pieces connecting with each other as it relates to gme i was taking notes while reading and below are the results of my notes this is still a hypothesis and theory but appears supported by numerous pieces of the puzzle i could be wrong but personally the pieces seem clear to me now one of the interesting things about gme and a big part of what triggered the short squeeze happening is the extraordinarily large short interest percentage reported by finra to be and later in the range of percent of total float another interesting factor is the extraordinarily high number of ftids both are strong indicators of the practice of naked short selling which in general is illegal in addition there have been many indications that there are far more shares out there then should exist there are many analysis and data points pointing to this but just one example where do these shares come from one potential explanation is synthetic long shares created via a loophole described here or counterfeit shares caused by naked shorting im an entrepreneur not a finance expert so i started doing some more digging on naked short selling to educate myself more on the subject i started with this “failures to deliver may result from either a short or a long sale there may be legitimate reasons for a failure to deliver for example human or mechanical errors or processing delays can result from transferring securities in physical certificate rather than bookentry form thus causing a failure to deliver on a long sale within the normal threeday settlement period a fail may also result from “naked” short selling” interesting we have a consistent and very high rate of ftids dating from and beyond an indicator that the stock has potentially been naked shorted for a long time according to former chairman of the sec christopher cox “abusive naked short sales can be used as a tool to drive down a companys stock price to the detriment of all of its investors the commission is particularly concerned about persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in the commissions regulation sho adopted just two years ago… selling short without having stock available for delivery and intentionally failing to deliver stock within the standard threeday settlement period is market manipulation that is clearly violative of the federal securities laws… we are particularly concerned about the potential negative effect that substantial and persistent fails to deliver may be having on the market in some securities specifically these fails to deliver can deprive shareholders of the benefits of ownership voting lending and dividends from issuers moreover they can be indicative of abusive naked short selling which could be used as a tool to drive down a companys stock price source in a different speech mr cox reiterated that short selling helps prevent irrational exuberance and bubbles but when someone fails to borrow and deliver the securities needed to make good on a short position after failing even to determine that they can be borrowed that is not contributing to an orderly market – it is undermining it” mr cox also “referred to the serious problem of abusive naked short sales” as “a tool to drive down a companys stock price and that the sec is concerned about the persistent failures to deliver in the market for some securities that may be due to loopholes in regulation sho which reminds me of this piece i wrote source for sec chairmans words as another datapoint robert j shapiro former undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs has claimed that naked short selling has cost investors $ billion and driven companies into the ground source this was originally in a time magazine article from which was deleted but the statement still exists in record in an sec filing from i also read ‘one complaint about naked shorting from targeted companies is that the practice dilutes a companys shares for as long as unsettled short sales sit open on the books this has been alleged to create phantom or counterfeit shares sometimes going from trade to trade without connection to any physical shares and artificially depressing the share price” shortly after i read that matt taibbi contended the use of naked shorting and counterfeit shares was the tactic used to help kill both bear sterns and lehman brothers taibbi said that the two firms got a push into extinction from a flatout counterfeiting scheme called naked shortselling source all these sources above seem to support the theory that gme stock was wildly naked shorted which put funds in the risk of being badly short squeezed if investing on the basis of the extraordinarily high short interest percentage gme was a prime candidate for a short squeeze to happen potentially even an infinite short squeeze on elon tweeted about gamestop and that was the day the stock entered the mainstream for a lot of people and retail investors began to really pile on to the stock outside of wsb the goal of this was to push the stock price up and trigger a short squeeze the theorized losers would be the funds that naked shorted and would be stuck in the squeeze on thursday when the stock had immense momentum from the moment pretrading started the stock shot up to in pretrading and it looked like the squeeze was going to happen that day the momentum was suddenly shut down when robinhood where many or potentially majority of retail investors were on were shut off from the ability to buy gme stock and only allow selling followed by several other brokers many believe this was a result of collusion and that this shut down allowed badly besieged hedge funds to close some positions while the public was shut out of buying but funds were not when this happened people were upset at robinhood suspecting it was a result of potential collusion between robinhood and citadel which along with point invested a lifeline of billion to melvin capital one of the short side funds and is also responsible for something like of robinhoods entire revenue by buying their order books but many also speculated collusion with dtcc itself now personally speaking its kind of crazy to think about dtcc being complicit in something like this however looking into the details of what happened a skeptical part of me became suspicious apparently what triggered the shut down on trading gme on that day was dtcc sending a letter at am to robinhood requiring them to come up with billion dollars so it sounds like it was essentially this dtcc letter that led to the shut down of the momentum on gme and the short squeeze happening on that day there were theories thrown out that dtcc was potentially complicit in the naked short selling of gme and intentionally did this to stem the massive blow backscandal if an infinite short squeeze did happen assuming the price of share of the price rocketed to or beyond which would be likely in the event of a short squeeze or infinite short squeeze hedge funds would likely go bankrupt as financially speaking there would be no way they would be able to cover all their shorts and presumably entities that lent the short side hedge fund the shares to short would be holding the bag worse dtcc would be exposed for being complicit in this entire thing i imagine it would be an incredible scandal to say the least then i read something that caught my eye… dtcc has had a history of being at the center and source of naked shorts from an article dating back to “depository trust amp clearing corp is a littleknown institution in the nations stock markets with a seemingly straightforward job it is the middleman that helps ensure delivery of shares to buyers and money to sellers about of the time trades are completed without incident but about of the shares valued at about $ billion on a given a day arent delivered to the buyer within the requisite three days for one reason or another these failures to deliver have put dtcc in the middle of a longrunning fight over whether unscrupulous investors are driving down hundreds of small companies share prices” source apparently the dtcc has been known to be allowing or complicit in this action for a very long time according to wall street journal “there is no dispute that illegal naked shorting happens the fight is over how prevalent the problem is and the extent to which dtcc is responsible some companies with falling stock prices say it is rampant and blame dtcc as the keepers of the system where it happens dtcc and others say it isnt widespread enough to be a major concern” source as a thought experiment lets say naked shorting is rampant in gme many many indicators point to this and lets say dtcc was ultimately responsible for allowing a wide scale naked shorting campaign on gme wouldnt it be in their best interest to make sure this doesnt get out and blow up in their faces something to consider because had they not done what they did on thursday many traders believe the squeeze wouldve happened that day from the wall street journal “the securities and exchange commission has viewed naked shorting as a serious enough matter to have made two separate efforts to restrict the practice the latest move came last month when the sec further tightened the rules regarding when stock has to be delivered after a sale but some critics argue the sec still hasnt done enough… some delivery failures linger for weeks or months until that failure is resolved there are effectively additional shares of a companys stock rattling around the trading system in the form of the shares credited to the buyers account critics say this phantom stock can put downward pressure on a companys share price by increasing the supply… critics contend dtcc has turned a blind eye to the nakedshorting problem” source from everything ive seen as someone who has been an observer and a participant of this saga starting from many things look very fishy and there are a lot of red flags people have documented i personally hold the following hypothesis gme shorts engaged in rampant naked shorting which lead to the short interest of the stock being and at various times and as late as reported by s to be gme shorts potentially hid their positions via a loophole of generating synthetic longs and using those to “cover” their positions but not truly covering which is illegal to cover using this particular method and which has the effect of delaying the short needing to be closed potentially betting on retail investors to lost interest and price to go back down before they truly close as a result of naked shorting a large amount of counterfeit shares are floating in the market leading to there being far more gme shares then the actual float the counterfeit shares canhave been used in aggressive naked short attacks to further drive down the price of gme which may have led to the precipiotous price drop starting last monday and which may have also been aided by if they were able to artificially cover their shorts using synthetic long shares due to the widespread naked shorting that all signs are pointing to dtcc which has had history of being accused of turning a blind eye to naked shorts mayve turned a blind eye to the rampant naked shorting happening in gme there was potentially collusion on to stop the short squeeze from happening whereby dtcc may be involved and may be implicated had the squeeze happened due to the position of naked shorts it would have been an unbelievable scandal if exposed edit someone asked so whats the current short position looks like they some how covered pasting my response below because id like people to see ive heard people say thats still a high number but personally i made the decision not to care about this percentage from the short interest report released today correct me if im wrong that number is generated from data hedge funds submit and hedge funds in this context have every incentive to submit data that would favor their current position apparently the fine they get for submitting false is nothing more than a slap on the wrista small fine i also believe hedge funds may have covered some shorts illegally using a loophole to generate synthetic longs to cover with more on that on my post here in addition there seems to have been some fuckery i recommend you give this a read with short interest numbers lately so for those reason i dont place much trust in the current reported short number and believe the real short interest percentage could be much higher,2021-02-09,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lglrg5/naked_shorting_in_gme_and_how_the_pieces_suddenly/,1612846800

with trading so i thought i would make another boring educational post for the millions of new traders who recently joined our community this will show you the best tutorials and tools you need to get started trading stocks and options even though i am a decent fulltime trader i am not a grammar expert so if you have any questions please comment them below and i will try and get back to them before we start please understand you should treat trading as a job because if you do it right it will be your only source of income in a year or two if you put in the effort and master your emotions list of apps videos and tools worth using mobile traders brokers feel free to offer your thoughts on these in the comments webull dough think or swim etrade tasty trade schwab option flow data see what options hedge funds are buying titanflow best for mobile traders flowalgo best for experienced traders with over k youtube videos to watch in order i can only provide video names because the links got my last post removed the ultimate stock trading course for beginners technical analysis secrets what most trading gurus will never tell you options trading for beginners the ultimate indepth guide stock market order types market order limit order stop loss stop limit common psychological trading mistakes how to build a profitable trading plan i assume most of you already have a broker you prefer but in case you do not i have listed a few good ones above what i like to tell new traders is to drop a small amount of money into your account something like $$ that you are willing to lose play around on the app and buy a few stocks nooooo optionssss and get a feel for your app or platform after you have some fun making your first few trades head over to youtube and watch the videos i listed above treat these videos as a class and bring a notebook to write down any notes you think are important or any questions you may have after each video go over your notes and ask questions in one of the many trading communities here on reddit then go back to your app or platform and test out what you have learned while again taking notes of things you notice after you do this proceed to the next video after you have watched the technical analysis video practice using your own technical analysis by visiting the trading view website if you have think or swim by td ameritrade etrade or another broker who has a platform for desktops you can do it straight from there which can be a huge bonus after you have watched the first two videos then you can bring your total account up to $ you will continue to practice trading using the skills you have learned so far you may make some profit or you may end up losing a few bucks its important to understand how your emotions are guiding your trading decisions every time before you hit the buy button you should ask yourself “should i really buy this” if you cant answer that question then under no circumstances should you be making that trade if you want to get started in options you can watch the third video but understand that while options can have amazing returns they also come with great risk the video is hours long so grab a snack and find a quiet spot where you cant be bothered that option video blew my mind and is one of the main reasons i am able to trade full time that video covers everything so i do not need to go more indepth here on options trading now we come to something that is soooooo important but usually takes traders far too long to understand the order type video will save you so much money because it will help you understand why market orders are usually not the right way to go especially when you are trading large amounts of capital during this whole time you should have been practicing how to trade and you might have wondered what the order types meant when you went to buy a few shares of stock again take notes and practice implementing what you have learned into your evolving trading style the next two videos are a great pair because the first one educates you on the emotional side of trading while the second video helps you learn to trade with a plan if you do not have your emotions under control i can tell you know that you will abandon that plan as soon as you see your account start to lose money you have to get rid of that sinking stomach feeling when the stocks not moving in the direction you want this definitely takes time but if you can mitigate these types of feelings you should have a solid understanding of how to start trading if you have time which most of you wont i recommend watching all of the tutorials again because you will take different things away from them compared to when you were just starting out doing all of this may take a couple of weeks or a few months if you have a busy work and family life but i encourage to make the effort so you can live the good life always remember why you started trading in the first place if you are just looking for fun or a quick buck you will probably end up losing way more than you ever imagined hope you enjoyed this boring post

lh6ttf,None,N/A,pass the bong and gather round bros were gonna likeumwhat were we doing again oh yeah were gonna talk about those chronic stocks and how you ganja gorillas can avoid becoming game gibbons,DD,90,0.73,NrdRage,279,hay hay ay listen up b lemme holler at you a minute i notice you been eyeing that portfolio real luscious like almost like you found a couple extra bananas under your tree am i right ampxb cool cool so whatchu holdin homey tillllllray aw yiss aphria yeah she fine as hell cgc oh lawd dat ass is bangin acb aw man you like the classics thats dope ogi into the up and comers respect young blood sndl ampxb sndl for real dude ampxb hi all nrdrage here you might remember me from such hits as pegging $gme dead right multiple times during its bubble making everybody rich on $riot exposing the $plug infinite money glitch accidentally helping start the $bb craze never getting an $amd weekly call right and being in an abusive relationship with the vix or maybe the sec and you how you can just say no to having them shove a mister fister up your ass alright apes its been a great few days being able to throw a dart at a wall of weed stocks and no matter where it sticks you make money its been a great run but if youre going to expand the acreage of your jungle and the amount of lady gorillas you earn the right to mate with you gotta start thinking a bit and that means hear me out thinking of how the hell you plan on getting out of sndl alive and yes i realize im saying this right after it spiked almost a hundo percent in the last hours look i was playing it too i grabbed some cs and a shit ton of cs on tuesday i also got out of both of those today though not as high up as i could have if you check my history youll see i even said i was goingt to eye a reentry then the market took a giant dump and gave me that entry but i passed on it because i had done some research by that point whatever profits profit ampxb heres the tldr its basically a penny stock thats gotten pumped to hell but the smart ape realizes when something has gone too mainstream and gets out of the way before the bulldozers wipe out his trees ampxb hey i love shoving a share price around a bit as much as the next guy i aint gonna talk shit about that but it seems like nobody has an exit strategy for this and im starting to see a lot of really stupid shit about holding to and all the other ridiculous bullshit from people who clearly dont even know what they fuck theyve invested in that the gme gibbons fell for ampxb heres the reality of sndl ampxb the company was on the verge of bankruptcy around thanksgiving they have no other markets other than canada which is ridiculously oversaturated with weed to the point that wholesale prices are less than a dollar a gram and they recently got forced to admit that their product fails to meet thc content requirements ampxb in case youre wondering what that means it means they sell skunkweed that they cut with paper and sawdust to make it cheaper they sell garbage and everyone knows it their brand is associated with low quality crap ampxb plus they actively solicited us to buy their stock to drive up the price then diluted it to fuck with a billion share offering now to their credit this not only enabled them to become debt free but also up their marketing budget and spend some time trying to create a brand dont get too excited fucking sams choice at walmart is a brand too doesnt mean you should stick a chub of their ground beef up your rectum by reason of them selling skunkweed their margins lag well behind that of their competitors ampxb looking at their financials theyve got million in cash laying around thats pretty good except theyre a company that burns million a quarter which means theyre going to dilute the fuck out of everyone again next month theyve got no exposure to the us market but had no problem dropping rumors that they were going to break in to the us market through licensing deals which turned out to be pot shop in bellingham washington they have no real expansion plan anywhere in the world for that matter ampxb bbubububut nrdrage stonk go up look at it sndl to the moon 🚀 🚀 🚀 ampxb yeah i know its fucking crazy to talk shit about a stock when its seemingly mid flight but here i am anyways not to talk you out of the weed party you should totally keep playing that for all its worth but rather to get people to see that theyve probably outgrown skunkweed now ampxb look the reason this thing mooned is because it was like a dollar hell it was cents not too far back with a stock worth a dollar its easy to get a lot of other apes to throw a couple of bananas at it for the lulz its easy to shove around a penny stock with an extra bucks you have laying around from another trade somewhere but as the price goes up so too goes up the perceived cost of entering i can make a strong unassailable in fact argument that $apha at $ is cheaper than sndl at but people are conditioned to like smaller numbers unfortunately as the gme gibbons learned eventually you run out of buyers and then things go tits up real fast ampxb as the prophet biggie smalls once said mo money equals mo problems we all know this equation to be true and here you are sitting on bags of bananas you didnt know you were gonna have a week ago thanks to some stonk you hadnt heard of before yesterday you dont think youve got a problem but you do because those bags of bananas arent edible until you turn them in to the bank for real cash if youre sitting on bananas from the gold standard of the weed world that would be $tlry youre resting pretty easy that no other ape is gonna come by and steal your bananas there are gonna be lots of bananas to go around and mostly were just taking bananas from fools who think their bananas will be less later but you dont have that with sndl all the bananas are currently sitting with people who think the bananas will go higher you cant all be right especially when there are billions of bananas and now your grandparents are starting to buy bananas because some boomer on cnbc told them it would make their dick bigger and their friends think they were cooler ampxb again im not telling you to leave the party ampxb but if you recall your dorm room years the best pizza you could afford was the tonys school lunchroom style shit for a dollar then you managed to hide a few bucks from the people who collect your student loans and you upgraded to dominos maybe by now youre ordering from a local joint that makes its own dough in house and the sauce is made with the love of an old italian grandma who accidentally dips her sagging tiddies into the pot times while making it that just makes it taste better thats science but i digress ampxb the point is you can get better weed now you dont have to smoke the skunk so before you get the rug pulled out from beneath you and are stuck investing in shitty penny stocks again maybe you should elevate your enterprise lets take a look at your options ampxb canopy growth you could go with $cgc they not only sell higher quality weed but are an established brand and also sell oils and shit to those hippie fucks who still think burning man isnt just a brogrammer beatfest and go to an acupuncturist to enhance their luck theyve captured that all important stoner demographic by marketing their shit as a cure for seizures cataracts and dry vag so theyve got a lot of revenue theyve also had a much more muted rise this week because they just havent been on everybodys lips which means theyve got a lot of room to run the downside here is they burn almost as much cash as sndl but theyve also got more bullets ampxb aurora if you go with $acb youre going with a company thats already gone through its shady as fuck stage and has reemerged healthy from it youre also not only getting on weed but the diy urban chicken farmer types who want to grow their own weed they too have had a strong run but have a lot more runway than most because theyve actually got a really strong path to dominance in the us market once it opens up to them ampxb organigram ampxb look if your dick is still getting hard at the thought of playing a low dollar stonk or youve only got dollars to invest you could do a lot worse theyve got strong branding large growth potential a management structure that doesnt seem to act shady and theyve run almost as well as the other new generation of meme stonks but lagged back enough because nobody can fucking rmeember their name to where they can rubber band a bit ampxb tilray and aphria ampxb im combining these because theyre inexorably joined at the hip or should be more on that later because the two of them are merging for those who dont know sometime in q every share of $apha you own will turn into shares of $tlry even though apha is the one buying out tlry this is basically the gold standard of weed stonkery when you start investing in these you know youre a real investor ampxb heres the interesting thing with these guys though even though aphia should be just slightly trailing behind tlry in terms of stock price its currently trading at less than half with tlry sitting at a share as i write this apha should be at just over $ but its at now obviously this means that tlry has a lot more momentum and some of that is due to the fact that theres a mini dont flog me for using the word but its true short squeeze going on with that one which has turned it into such a strong momentum play but apha by virtue of actual math needs to be within about of tlrys price which means apha either needs to moon dramatically or tlry needs to fall precipitously now either of those things could happen but the momentum of tlry is hard to stop which means its more likely that apha rubber bands to catch up to it in the coming months even if tlry does falter that means apha still has to come up a bit to meet it making apha kind of a cant go tits up situation tlry also has the benefit of having enough market cap to where fund bois will buy into it whereas sndl is too small to meet most of their requirements which can further propel tlry and thus drag apha with it ampxb one of the interesting things thats been happening with this pair is that the order books even though they should mirror one another have completely inverted from one another numerous times in the last couple of days this of course was a bull flag for tlry every time it happened leaving apha to compensate to try and catch back up shortly thereafter its really easy money ampxb fundamentally these guys have one huuuuuuuge advantage over the others they secured the uk distribution and now have the inside track to be the supplier for the rest of the europoors across the pond who need to smoke a bond to help forget all the things wrong with them and if you dont think they wont be able to leverage that to be the front runners out of the gate when the us opens for business then you definitely aint black ampxb or you can just stay where you are and do the 💎👐 thing ampxb ask the $gme gibbons how well that worked out for them the ones still holding that stonk are like that one dude sitting at the edge of the bar of the viper room still rocking his mullet and chain wallet just convinced that warrant and slaughter are going to ring in the glory days of hair metal once more and that queensryche is going to start selling out stadiums again its just sad youre flying right now but a rug is gonna get pulled out from under you and then youre gonna have your own daily thread where you reassure yourselves that its gonna be ok and that youre gonna ride it to a thousand one day lots of us myself included made a fuck ton of money on gme and weve made a fuck ton on sndl and the rest of the weedies this week but there are always people who melvin it and hang on to their position too long and get stuck thats gonna be a lot of you but you shouldnt let it be you ampxb tldr smart apes should look at their much bigger pile of bananas from sndl while youre way ahead and upgrade them to plantains before the other apes plaintains equals breeding with better apes not low quality apes that cannibalize fellow apes and give ape diseases ampxb all my love ampxb chad dickens ampxb ampxb edit i forgot to list my positions cgc none acb none ogi shares $ c

the play today i want to bring $trxc to your attention i know you already know this stock but bear with me it has just crossed b market cap in a pretty awesome rally that started only a couple days ago and it has grown over today at the time of writing this dd but who are $trxc you may ask transenterix build the devices no fuck this the battlestations for surgeons to operate with the minimally invasive procedure known as laparascopy their system is called senhance essentially a robotic device pokes some holes in your tummy and without opening you up for good some little arms with tools cameras light are introduced in your poor unfit office body to fix whatever is broken afterwards the holes are stitched together and you can recover quickly and with fewer marks ok ok you may say why should this shit interest me does this not exist already how do they do it i am glad you ask this does exist yes and the industry standard is the wellknown da vinci surgical system by intuitive surgical $isrg so what the fuck is interesting about $trxc a couple things senhance is a more modern system with haptic feedback and even fucking eye tracking for camera control sauces the concept is that the surgeon and the machine fuse into one becoming you know a robocop or something like that transenterix bets for aipowered machine vision to for example make the systems camera automatically follow the tools being used and this beast already has the ce sign for commercialization in europe and fda clearance sauces insiders have started moving and buying more stock just two days ago on monday they have started training surgeons in japan to conquer their market and know the boring fundamentals market cap b at the moment of typing this public float m you can forget about pe but lets take a look at its competitor $isrg market cap b public float m ampxb so while the float is admittedly larger for $trxc they are still extremely undervalued if they are to be compared with their competitor of course of course its a small company and establishing new surgical standards is complicated but to me they look like a steal even at the current price and wanna see how much they were in the past oh yes they were worth a couple dollars more i might have forgotten something or might have gotten something wrong because needless to say ampxb i am not a financial advisor this is not

is below b its not ampxb edit aaand they bet for remote operations aka telesurgery and this is what such a system looks like for the jackasses saying lol you called that a battlestation ampxb right about to operate the funny jackasses in the comments of a severe case of sugma edit i dont have time to write too much about it right now this already ate up my fun time today but their management is also pretty good might write something on them in the following days ampxb edit i did find more fun time some doctors in germany wrote a paper on senhance testing its feasibility and compared it to da vinci the comparison with da vinci points out the reduced cost of using senhance gt the ability to utilize conventional laparoscopic and mm trocars stands out in comparison to the da vinci® robotic system which incorporates its own and mm ports since fully reusable instruments are used by this surgical robotic system an advantage regarding cost efficacy is expected when compared to the da vinci® system excluding the acquisition costs of the senhance™ surgical robotic system the robotspecific cost per case at our department was euros covering the expenses for drapes instruments and maintenance according to a flat ratebased service contract this comes in contrast to costs as high as euros for drapes and instruments with da vinci® robotic system while excluding maintenance and acquisition costs and another paper this paper is not accessible for free so let me just copy the conclusions for you autists to salivate gtour experience with diferent types of robotic surgeries allows us to state that the senhance® robotic system is feasible and safe for general surgery gynecology and urology and a wider implementation of this system worldwide is simply a question of time

lojn4x,GME,290.15%,a bug in schwab caused my retirement account to go naked short gme,Discussion,10,0.69,Fragsworth,133,this is a story that involves gme but it is not about gme the events im describing here happened on january in my cash retirement account in short i had some gme shares and used the interface to sell them immediately after i read that robinhood announced the disabling of their buy button a few minutes later it did not appear to work so i attempted to sell again subsequently my account showed that both sells went through then my account had the cash from both sales and a negative balance of shares that i was required to deliver in days after seeing the stock price dramatically rise and my apparent liabilities increasing without limit i freaked out and covered the short position at a huge loss $k if i was lucky and the price went down i could have been able to cover the short at a huge gain and could have kept my mouth shut not that i would have but instead im out a bunch of money in my retirement account that was a result of this bug and schwab owes me about $k had i not covered this erroneous short position the shorts probably would have become what we know to be failures to deliver i have attached the record of what happened below which i sent to schwab soon after the event to try to get the situation undone i eventually was able to call their support team and they said i would have to wait days to resolve the situation the guy on the phone said they were having lots of problems with this bug in other equities too i cant recall the complete conversation anyway i recently got a message in the system that i would have to wait another days so i flipped my shit and now im posting about it here please dont comment about how retarded i am for investing my retirement in gme thats not the story i do what i want i like the stock and there is a serious problem here completely unrelated to how retarded i am and the general public absolutely needs to know what is going on i have no information about how many naked short positions were created other than it was more than just myself and in other equities as well i have no information about whether or not the bug still exists i did not test it it may very well be the case that the bug is still a problem as far as i know related i recently posted something that made me suspicious to rstocks i didnt realize this until today but i connected the dots between the details of this post and what happened to me in my schwab retirement account ie schwabtd are the same company and these two things could be related here is the message i sent to schwab for a record of what happened you might notice that its a k which most people might note does not usually allow individual stock trading but it is a selfmanaged fund and individual stocks are actually allowed start of message to whom it may concern my name is my account number is i attempted to call your number several times but i was unable to get through to your support here is a breakdown of what happened there is a bug in your system that caused my nonmargin account to briefly become short gme shares my account is a nonmargin k account in good faith i spent $k to cover the position that my account should not have been allowed to get into two trades need to be undone at market open my position this morning was nnnn shares of gme at i attempted to place a market order to sell nnnn shares order aaaaaaaa the order did not show up for about minutes my account balance still showed nnnn shares so i attempted to make a similar order again i placed a sell of limit or better to sell nnnn shares at $ order bbbbbbbb about minutes later i got confirmations for both orders and a notice that the account was due securities i do not have a margin account and it should not have gone short the system should have rejected one of the orders because the shares were not in my account once i realized what the system did i saw the short position which your system erroneously put me in and to protect from the potential infinite uncovered losses on my account i did a market buy at am for nnnn shares using the buy to cover button which zeroed out my position in gme order cccccccc the erroneous trade needs to be undone and my buy to cover also needs to be undone as both of these are not legal trades for my k orders bbbbbbbb and cccccccc should not exist on my account bbbbbbbb is a result of a bug in your trading system and cccccccc was a good faith attempt for me to prevent the issue from becoming a much bigger problem im sending this in a timely manner so there is a record of what happened and i will refer to it when i call again when your call volume is reduced end of message disclosure my current positions in my k are as follows ignoring what schwab owes me gme shares cash amp money market $k again please dont comment about the intelligence or stupidity of my investing strategies none of this is advice if you do anything related to what im talking about here youre probably

loio0b,None,N/A,i am going to buy gamestop all of it dont upvote this its mostly to reference later,Shitpost,44,0.8,lookshee,1052,to start i would like to be very clear i am in no way investing in the short squeeze and for what i am doing it does not matter whether or not it already squoze vs you are here volkswagon graph my goal is not to make money my goal is not to lose money i am not trying to send a message i do not care about your upvotes i will not be donating any proceeds to charity namely because my goal implies that there will be no proceeds my goal is to own gamestop as absolutely much of it as i possibly can while i am alive and on this planet because of this i want gme shares price to go down whether this occurs due to algodriven price suppression or organic sellingoff of shares the more the value drops the more shares i can afford to buy obligatory not financial advice i like the stock i fully expect everyone to watch me lose money on this here are the facts mark cuban raised a very valid point if you are investing in a company the way we used to as a person who actually wants to own a piece of that company then prices going down is a good thing cheaper cost of entry position expansion gamestop is poised to dominate the space within the gaming industry looking to build esports arenas guess what gyms are going out of business left and right cheap real estate dedicated gaming streaming channel disney and others are already on that bus for their niches so dedicated game streaming platform owned by the single most universal name in gaming would be no surprise im not talking about livestreams im talking about produced content speaking of live twitch discord already set up and instead of competing gamestop could literally just buy these companies and relabel them gwitch and gamescord or leave them as is just own the revenue streams there are so many more things possible for a centralized brand with clear intentions of being a cultural hub epicenter really for such a massively exploding industry an industry with zero sign of slowing down ever entertainment as an allthings umbrella industry will only become bigger and more valuable as our human lives become increasingly comfortable and more necessary as we deal with increasing amounts of stress when shit goes badly interactive entertainment is just unrivaled the man the legend the boyfriend to all of our wives dfvroaring kittymr g just doubled his shares position he undoubtedly recognizes the potential negative impact that him selling his entire position on gme would have on the stock and i have little to no doubt that he has already pulled millions of dollars off the top of his originally exploding positions values remember all those calls he had that were absolutely blowing up i didnt do the math and im not gonna but id be willing to bet money that he didnt turn of those profits into shares anywhere near the top because of this he has negative downside risk gamestop could go bankrupt and he would still come out ahead im in a much much smaller but similar boat i made $k and kept shares which i fully intend to take to my grave this is the thing that got me thinking about this in the first place gamestop will never be forgotten this is a stock which will be discussed in investment classes until the end of time the face of investing will be changed forever because of wsb and the gme phenomenon even if there are not new regulations trade taxes the world will always always remember gme i am just fine financially my small business generates $k to $kyear in revenue this is not a yolo play i can afford to lose the money i am putting in do not slide into my dms seeking financial assistance see above where i discuss proceeds and how they wont exist so theres no money anyway the plan buy as many shares as i can afford never expecting to see that money ever again sell a few covered calls way in the future at or out of the money as they approach expiration roll them forward another year this will either reduce my cost basis as the price drops or secure and yes limit upside potential in the case of the stock going up significantly in value as long as these options do not get exercised i will still own the shares i would prefer these options expire worthless so i may expand my share count over the cash roi every year see below somewhere as i earn more money externally buy more shares again as many as i can afford every single year just constantly expand my position no matter what forever profit never not ever sell a single share use any capital gained from selling covered calls to you guessed it buy more shares remember my goal here is to own shares not to make money any money earned from selling calls will turn into more shares any money earned externally that i do not need access to will be turned into more shares currently atthemoney covered calls expiring about a year out are effectively worth of the value of the stock assuming the stock value declines or stagnates yoy then i could theoretically increase my position by a solid each year yes there will be a decrease in iv in this case but using externallyearned money i should be able to make up the difference first milestone overtake udeepfuckingvalue in share volume i will never beat his gains and i may never exceed his actual cash value returns but that is fine my goal is purely share count second milestone overtake ryan cohen in share volume my understanding is that he currently owns million shares i havent dug any deeper than literally the first thing that pops up on google when you type ryan cohen gamestop shares and im not gonna anything further is basically the deep web and million shares is a plenty fast rabbit to chase to keep myself motivated i am confident that i will fail at my second milestone as it would likely be reliant on ryan selling his ownership in the company and moving on to do something else with his life before i get old and die third milestone own run and manage gamestop whatever that means member of the board sure bust in on meetings like hey i own most of this place someone grab me a coffee and then yell about how i pay your salary as im being escorted out by security more likely but im not gonna stop until i am at the head of that table even if i have keep at this until i am years old or even if it happens right before gamestop finally gives up the ghost and goes bankrupt with this strategy cumulatively expanding my position by yoy i should be able to turn a share portfolio into a millionshare portfolio in years this is just based on current prices options values and my current income it couldnt bother me less if it goes to $ $ or $ per share at a certain point cash infusion for shares from my income will grossly outweigh the rate at which options can possibly expand my ownership of the stock i like this stock and if that means i end up owning enough shares to run that shit myself then i will consider my life a massive success the only disappointment i could possibly experience with this plan its not even a strategy at this point would be if gme finally squeezes all at once and all these options get exercised calling all my shares away from me increasing my net worth by all at once or if gme just does really well organically which would significantly slow down the rate at which i could expand my ownership in shares becoming a millionaire would be cool and all but im trying to do something specific here sec interns im just sharing my thoughts and am in no way advising anything to anyone i just like the damn stock hedgies and mms please crank up your algos to maximum never stop doing what youre doing i need this thing continually dropping so i can keep my covered call money and amass shares yoy current 💎🙌 shareholders you are the only thing standing in my way and the ask ladder is pretty brutal with all yalls memeass prices if at some point you get bored and sell off to take profits i will thank you for it if you wanna dump that shit all at once and not worry about it maybe shoot for buying back in lower id appreciate that even more yes im going to be updating yall weekly or monthly or annually whatever might be a little bit to get started as im currently working to get all of my cash out of rh and somewhere better but hey i have years to get this sorted out right make fun of me as i lose money ask me for advice as i make money call me an idiot for the platforms i use try to sell me access to your crappy webbased indicator research tools none of it will matter whether i am a fool or a genius will undoubtedly be decided by a cointoss of whether or not gme becomes fundamentally valuable i suppose tldr there is no tldr i

lpdzu0,None,N/A,did dfv unwittingly discovered the soft underbelly of ws establishment,DD,18,0.85,JMartinUSN,17,taking the roaring kitty at his stated motivation to “invest long” and particularly in stock he likes “i did not solicit anyone to buy or sell the stock for my own profit” gill plans to testify “i did not belong to any groups trying to create movements in the stock price i never had a financial relationship with any hedge fund i had no information about gamestop except what was public i did not know any people inside the company and i never spoke to any insider” the reaction from ws establishment reacted swiftly to curtail free trade obviously due to the achilles heel exposed by gill simply exercising his right as an american to invest in something he believes in what gill did although he most certainly didnt set out to do was expose a massive weakness in the american financial industry that the us government has utterly failed to prevent side note i am not a financial analyst i am a dod analyst i do no give financial advice i dont trade on margin and i dont short stock i hold no gme i do hold amc if you accept elitist propaganda they would have you believe there is some redeeming value in taking short positions—mostly because they claim it helps correct overvalued securities this fundamentally breaks the law of fair trade where the exchange is good for both parties at the time short trades provided no value added to the investment cycle and incentivize the philosophy that business loss is profitable and an option to reap due to others misfortune the problem with that philosophy is real business loss has real consequences to investors employers employees econ students learn this gill was exercising his right as a goddam american to invest believe and possibly save a good company from bankruptcy despite gmes management short comings it might have been believable that rh stopped trading because their liquidity was in jeopardy and the collateral required to cover settlement would have broken their bank…but there should have been an expectation of restricted trades across the board not targeting gme or amc and the telltale sign of collusion may be that other brokers also halted trading why thats not been discovered there are some great postulations here on wsb for instance if you believe what financial analysts are saying you find yourself admitting that wsb is now wielding a nuclear weapon capable of ripping the shit out of the financial markets is this even conceivable take these quotes for instance “but theres another level of danger to the gamma squeezes this involves the relentless highvolume buying in lowpriced far outofthemoney call options to drive a stock price higher by forcing the market maker to purchase the stock as protection against their selling the calls assuming they cant find another party to take the risk for market makers unable to pass the risk they could soon find themselves out of business we could also see market makers begin to abandon stocks” – real money “such damage to general asset prices producing the worst week for the sampp index since october pales in comparison to what would most likely happen if one of the intermediaries were forced into a disorderly deleveraging whether it be a broker or central clearinghouse if not handled well this could have much broader effects especially because the nonbank segment of the financial system has been in an unprecedented period of rapidly rising debt leverage and risktaking aided and abetted by too many years of excessive policy reliance on experimental central bank measures and regulatorysupervisory gaps… …this is not just an epic david versus goliath story that has now attracted worldwide media attention potentially in play is the democratization of finance techled disruptions to market hierarchy the overall valuation of markets regulatory and political responses and the market structure itself” – bloombergcom the rhetoric coming from ws is quite the freudian slip they basically revealed that their business is all about manipulating the markets something everybody knew but didnt really understand how to stop… in comes populist investment groups like wsb wielding millions of small buys like a hoard taking on goliath death of thousand cuts… several analysts on camera admitted openly that gme would have easily gone to $ if it were not for the brakes being slammed regardless of your political leanings big tech censorship should be a concern… this is a blatant attempt at squeezing the little guy out letting the hfs act like bulls in a china cabinet if a company is going under and a bunch or private citizens want to save it while making money… more power to you… the government should be concerned with some state actor with deep pockets using proxy buyers to cause short squeeze after short squeeze… you thought game stop was dangerous given the sentiment it is entirely possible that gme could go

lpdni5,None,N/A,the greatest market bubble of all time a full bear counterthesis,Discussion,11,0.82,ContentViolation1488,821,ampxb the more things change the more they stay the same there is nothing new under the sun ampxb in every market bubble you always hear the same language the same rationalizations the same absurd arguments these people think they are offering some new unique insight in reality all they offer are the same manic rationalizations that existed in every other bubble market in history lets address the primary two bull rationalizations today before we set into the bear thesis ampxb interest rates are low nowhere for money to go except stocks when you really drill down into it this is some bizarre logic its essentially saying you are forced to make more risky bets if less risky bets are less profitable in other words its a manifestation of the greedy fomo mindset that occurs precisely during bubbles ultimately these bull arent even arguing that we arent in a bubble they are arguing we are in a bubble but that the bubble is justified the obvious counter is that holding cash is neither impossible nor even undesirable in a lowinterest rate environment whats the worst that can happen if i sit on a pure cash portfolio i lose per year not good of course but not the end of the world either whats the worst that can happen if i dump all my money into stocks at all time highs and the market crashes i lose of my funds in as little as a month ouch the idea that im forced to risk losing a huge percentage of my capital because losing a year is simply impossible to endure is the sort of logic that can only arise under a euphoric bubble mindset of course the premise that these bulls are relying on is that the market simply wont crash or that they will be prescient enough to calmly hop out of the market once a crash becomes obvious but the whole point is that the crash is never obvious especially to permabulls they see a dip and they buy it they see a deeper dip what a great opportunity so they buy more and before they realize the dip isnt simply a dip they are already fucked tale as old as time the funny thing is this argument can be used to justify almost any investment no matter how irrational why hold cash when bonds pay more why buy bonds when index funds pay more why buy index funds when spacs pay more why buy spacs when flipping cocaine pays more after all if you assume that holding cash is simply impossible since it loses to inflation what sort of high risk investment can you not justify whats most interesting is that this argument isnt even new the ridiculously low interest rates set by the fed in the past were precisely what sowed the seeds for the massive housing bubble that led to the crash the fed is ultimately a bubble creator something even wsb is well aware of if you sit out this rally you will end up behind even if you are right this is perhaps the most popular argument of permabulls they argue that if you sat out the last months something this is essentially a straw man argument except in reference to permabears then you would have missed out on massive gains and therefore the implicit argument is you can never sit out if you carefully analyze this argument you will realize it is literally nothing more than fomo to the extreme its fear of missing out disguised as macroeconomic theory i have to stay in the market perpetually i can never sit out because if i do i will miss out on gains and you better stay in the market with me otherwise you will miss out too dummy first of all i will admit this is a good argument against people who are legitimately permabears people who do sit out a market in fear for months and months do actually miss out on substantial gains but not everyone signalling the warning signs of a bubble are permabears there are clear historical signals of an irrational bubble and those who pay attention to such signals are not missing out they are simply protecting their wealth against irrational greed an intelligent investor is neither a bull nor a bear they adapt to the market and when an intelligent investor adapts and becomes a bear in a raging bull market you can be sure there will be no shortage of bulls attacking them as a stupid permabear the bulls think they will get wise before the crash hurts them but their greed is precisely what will prevent that scenario from playing out ampxb lets take a look at some of the signs we are in the greatest bubble in history ampxb major indicators of the great bubble ampxb massive retail investment worldwide what are some signs of bubbles historically well a sure metric is when you get massive public interest and investment in the market do we have that today check on fucking steroids weve got people who cant change a fucking tire on their civic downloading robinhood and gambling options on margin like wtf the iq mongoloid who was washing dishes at papa johns last tuesday do they even have dishes i dont fucking know is now buying leveraged call options on a fucking electric vehicle company in fucking china or some shit are you kidding me do we need any more evidence that the top is rapidly approaching not to mention the entire shortsqueeze fiasco which got international coverage and just threw some nitroglycerin into the speculative fire now everyone from my grandmother to some farmer in bangladesh is downloading robinhood to buy calls on fucking sndl or whatever the fuck past us market bubbles were largely restricted to the us population it was mostly americans buying american stocks during the dotcom boom but wild irrational bubble speculation has been globalized now almost anybody in the world can dump their hard earned rupees into tesla at a pe ratio whats that noise is that some greedy billionaire goblin audibly salivating in the distance the max pain theory which is ironically popular among permabulls argues that the market will do whatever hurts the maximum numbers of investors this is of course bullshit but its food for thought if you buy into this type of voodoo ridiculously speculative investments aka spacs cciv is worth billion dollars and it owns literally nothing no deal is in place no announced deal figures have been offered obviously the spac has no earnings or revenue to speak of just billion dollars dumped on pure rumors and hopium i can think of no stronger manifestation of irrational greed what is a spac at the end of the day a rich guy steps up and says give me your money and ill decide what ill do with it in a few months and a million retards step up and say sounds great take my money tell me this spac shit isnt exactly like the dotcom boom when literally anything with a com in its name was worth millions overnight because the internet was the hot new thing there is no way this spac mania lasts and lots of people will be hurt in the end options volume absolutely exploding options are becoming the vehicle of choice for investors aka gamblers in the current market stock represents actual ownership of a company the foundation of the actual market but what kind of boomer wants to actually invest in a profitable company long term i just want to get insane leverage and dump my gamble on the next bigger sucker the question i sometimes ask is how much of this market growth is really a manifestation of market makers delta hedging this insane options volume you know like derivative cdos leveraging worthless mortgages back in its something to think about ill just leave this chart here since it makes the case for me this is neither natural nor sustainable greater fool logic ill just quote investopedia since im getting lazy here the greater fool theory states that it is possible to make money by buying securities whether or not they are overvalued by selling them for a profit at a later date this is because there will always be someone ie a bigger or greater fool who is willing to pay a higher price if acting in accordance with the greater fool theory an investor will purchase questionably priced securities without any regard to their quality if the theory holds the investor will still be able to quickly sell them off to another “greater fool” who could also be hoping to flip them quickly unfortunately speculative bubbles burst eventually leading to a rapid depreciation in share prices the greater fool theory breaks down in other circumstances as well including economic recessions and depressions in when investors purchased faulty mortgagebacked securities it was difficult to find buyers when the market collapsed basically none of you mouthbreathers are doing fundamental analysis on the shit you buy nobody here cares about fair or instrinsic value this is talking about you buffet indicator through the roof the buffet indicator has reach its highest ever level for noobies who dont know what this means the buffett indicator takes total market valuation and divides it by us gdp a very high buffett indicator suggests an overvalued market and could have been used to predict past bubbles such as the dotcom boom there are two arguments against the buffett indicator as a useful metric the first argument is that gdp is a backward indicator and therefore doesnt account for future growth while this is true it misses the entire point the point is that future growth estimations can be faulty and lend themselves to irrational greed during bubbles the point is to tie market valuations to some realworld metric which is necessarily backward looking the other argument against the buffett indicator which holds more weight is that us stocks consist of global companies and therefore arent adequately represented by us gdp i will say these people have a good point but they are also missing several nuances within gdp and market valuations which are too complicated to address in this already fucking huge post suffice it to say the buffett indicator still has something useful to say about market valuation and cant simply be discarded valuations divorced from reality during every major bubble people like to come up with new fancy ways of evaluating the worth of a company back in the dotcom boom companies that obviously had zero revenue or sales were valued in terms of eyes that is the value of the company was based on how many visits they had to their website this internet thing was a new paradigm and so obviously we needed new metrics to determine how valuable these companies were needless to say the vast majority of these companies many of them worth millions were simply worth nothing and went bankrupt overnight take your pick of favorite meme stonk that has some bizarre rationalization for its absurd valuation i like to pick on tesla personally because trolling its angry cultlike followers is simply good fun fed manipulation most bubbles have been created by federal reserve control of currency and interest rates this market is no different they create a bubble and when the bubble pops they hop in to create a new bigger bubble until that pops and so on its like a fucking meth addict taking bigger and bigger hits until they see fucking leprechauns burrowing under thier house the catch is interest rates cant drop below zero i mean they can but who wants to be japan for the rest of history alright ive written enough already and i wont write a whole thesis on fed action and its consequences for now global markets ill just leave this pic here tldr shit is fucked son play the game of chicken as long as you want but at the end of the

lqqp0u,None,N/A,crowd sourcing dd there is a massive payment card data breach going on,DD,294,0.95,quantize_me,321,tldr check all of your credit and debit cards for fraudulent charges there are reports of a tidal wave of fraudulent charges across different banks and payment networks lets get to the bottom of this and buy the puts that will send us to valhalla currently there is no mainstream reporting of these fraud charges i have puts on bbva fis and fisv again check all of your debit cards and credit cards for unauthorized transactions some of the more common ones are coloadtest angela singleton spotify sumup wfxb and amzncom report the transactions as fraudulent so that your card gets locked instead of simply disputing the charge tidal wave of fraud charges in the links below you will find pages of people reporting small and large fraudulent transactions ive read comments of affected people many of them note that customer service has told them that a lot of other people are disputing similar fraud charges moreover these charges are bizarre in their diversity of payment networks banks and workarounds that they use eg some fraudulent charges are on prepaid gift cards some fraudulent charges are on cards that were cancelled resent and fraudulently charged while still in the mail some fraudulent charges posted to cards that were closed possibly by manipulating a recurring charge mechanism below are links to some of the data points i broke the links because my previous submissions were autospammed sorry there is also a table below where i summarized some of the data before i got tired of data entry most data doctorofcreditdotcomwidespreadunauthorizedtransactionscheckyouraccountscoloadtestcomsumup redditcomrpersonalfinancecommentslnbyqcoloadtestcomcharge

more recent data on the doctorofcredit link collaborator uwisehope made this spreadsheet for the reddit data points megadotnzfilebggqxarkhaadasejtmmkufpzxwmrghnfridecnrypg ampxb to summarize the table almost all major credit card issuing banks and almost all major credit card payment networks have been hit mastercard has been maybe less affected some cards have only been used once one card was never used some cards were gift cards some cards were cancelled and then charged when a new card was sent but before it was received in the mail one of the most interesting leads is the commenter who said this data is being shared on the dark web and he got that from a source called idx i have no idea what that is inferences this was probably not an attack on a retailers database because many cards were only used once this was probably not an attack on issuing banks since so many were affected one possible exception is bbva since their cards were the victims of the earliest attacks and have been attacked in relatively large quantity likewise amex and visa are more sus than other payment networks but still not high on the list of suspects some agent that many banks and payment networks use is the most likely culprit this could be a software vendor it could be a faulty pipeline to a credit report company transunion equifax experian that is adding payment info this breach is deep in the system if they are able to hit cards that are ostensibly locked and that are being sent in the mail after the first is cancelled likewise this is probably not a stale breach from long ago since the fraudsters are able to update their card info to these newly mailed cards many are reporting the same fraudulent charges eg coloadtest angela singleton cfxb and sumup so we know these are part of the same breach or set of breaches by the same hacker the sumup charges are being sent to brazil thats a good place for international financial crimes since brazil does not extradite citizens suspicions i think the most likely source of the quantity and variety of breached cards is a deep attack on a acquirer processor an acquirer is the bank that handles the transaction for the merchant merchant acquirers are the banks that handle transaction risk acquirer processors actually process the transactions some banks do both for example chase jpm some banks do not for example wells fargo wfc hands off the processing to fiserv fisv a processor is the most likely to be able to generate the kind of data needed for this attack they would see data from across many banks and payment networks they would have the ability to collect new card data after reissues and data from cards that were never used in the hack of fis the hackers were able to get into prepaid debit card vanilla gift card data that hack led to a sustained downturn in the fis stock price i suspect a similar breach will do the same krebsonsecuritydotcomfdicfisbreachworsethanreported i collected data below from people who only ever used their card at a very small number of retailers to get a sense of which acquirer processor is most likely to have been hacked the data is unfortunately not very conclusive theres also a possibility that there were multiple breaches and these attacks are being mixed to obscure the origin im hoping some of you know more about the innards of the payment network system or legacy software that banks use to support it im hoping that we can put together a case for a most likely suspect company and make a killing with our early dd ampxb positions i have a small quantity of otm puts in bbva fis and fisv im not ready to yolo the account until i have more confidence the right targets are selected edit a be sure to check out the comments below on a potential bin attack b i

commodities as the stock market seems too risky in comparison deutsche bank analyst michael linenberg said it was time to buy into airline stocks as covid cases hospitalizations and vaccination rates

you may know i was bullish on home depot short term and long term and thought they would beat earnings im for sure disappointed but i still see the long term value in it quick things im looking for today powells speech quick thoughts companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now people are scared of inflation and of the stock market this is old news at this point so theyre looking for other investments even if it doesnt go up in value it just needs to beat inflation anything that can make them get rid of their dollars theyre not too happy with gold for some reason i explain this in the next section theyre trying their hands with beatcn but that can be a bit risky and too new for some people old people mostly so how about alternative investments watches wine pens whiskeys sneakers even pokémon cards anything for the love of god take my god damn money oh and when i say people im mostly talking about rich people or anybody with enough disposable income to worry about this stuff it happens a lot in the us and in europe but a place where it might happen much more than usual is china you see china has this terrible habit of devaluying their own currency this helps with exports and with reducing unemployment but lately they couldnt keep up with the us usa number one with the trillions poured into the economy so right now chinas yuan is pretty valuable in comparison with the dollar but this will not stay that way or at least the chinese government will do everyting in their power to not let that happen it needs a good economy low unemployment and overall satisfaction of their population or else their power are in danger and the devaluation of their currency is one of the sure very easy ways of doing so so if i was chinese im not im a martian hiding behind a rock because ive seen an alien coming out of its spaceship but if i was chinese i would buy a lot of watches or anything americans do i say if i was chinese but again its really if i had a lot of disposable income and want to diversify my assets to hedge against inflation and currency risks and chinese people are just a more extreme case of this so yeah anyway nice story to say that companies that sell luxury goods that hold their value are hot right now because people want to put their money somewhere really anywhere chinese people want to buy us luxury goods to hedge against the devaluation of their currency rich people want to buy stuff that hold their value without the risk of the stock market a lot of rich people made money during the pandemic and dont know where to put it a lot of people are bored and shopping for anything cool luxury goods being one of those things might want to short gold gold has been for decades the best hedge against inflation and stock market risks thats because its decorrelated from any currency dollar euro yen or the swedish krona if thats what youre into because theres a fixed supply of it by gold mining companies and because a lot of it is stored safely in central banks reserves the price of gold is not too volatile either so its the perfect hedge to diversify a bit any metal are viewed as an hedge but gold became the standard for it thats because a lot of currencies were using the gold standard not only that drove central banks to store a lot of gold and keep it even after they switched to the monetary system we know now money printer brrr and all that but that safety feeling that gold had back then stayed in the minds of a lot of people what kept that feeling alive even further was that its a tangible asset that had a real world use not just a piece of paper that holds value just because some big entity said so so all that to say gold is a good hedge against the market and inflation except right now investors dont want to touch it that much even when the risks are as high as ever so why well lets explore those reasons a bit before that i want to give a few disclaimers first not financial advice but also this is mostly speculations while we can have a good idea as to why the market behaves the way it does gold is mostly driven by the sentiment of a lot of very different investors with very different perspective strategies and personal risk tolerance the stock market and other commodities are like that too but fundamentals play a much bigger role for them gold on the other hand is mostly a speculative asset so thats for the warnings now lets see what those reasons are first gold went up a lot at the beginning of from $ in march to $ in august thats a nice increase in an insane bull market people were eager to put their money in any asset mostly the stock market but gold was nice too but in august gold became overvalued and signs started to appear that this bullish sentiment was not sustainable add to that the fact that the armageddon that investors feared in march didnt actually happen investors wisely switched from gold to stonks and other assets but stonks are not the only asset that was down a lot during march oil too there was a mix of geopolitics and people staying at home so didnt need gas anyway when all that fear calmed down investors bought a lot of oil at those very cheap prices and oil became the commodity of choice for hedging purposes another asset was chosen beatcn you know what i mean while it didnt have as much impact on gold as oil and stonks it still probably hurt it a little so you might say thats a nice writup buddy youre explaining the past here but you said we should short gold now so what gives well first thanks i put a lot of effort into those posts and its nice that its appreciated but also all of those reasons still apply today and theres more the rising bond yields make tbund much more attractive than gold much lower risk with a pretty nice roi and if institutions want bigger yields they are probably ok with buying high yield bonds since the fed and governement seem to do everything they can to keep businesses afloat also a lot of institutions invest in beatcn making it a more attractive and legitimate investment that drives the price higher therefore making it more attractive and so on so if theres no catalyst that shifts this bearish sentiment this slow downtrend is set to continue the biggest catalyst that i can see for gold is that america and the rest of the world theres not just america reopens but if it does then that means the economy will be much better and investors will buy stonks even more instead of gold another small catalyst is that beatcn becomes very risky again institutions will sell and write off those losses elon musk already said he would do that with his tesla investment they will probably buy gold again as a result so in my opinion the bear thesis boils down to stocks oil beatcn and bonds and other assets being attractive while gold is being forgotten a bit and that might not change for a while while the bull thesis is that a catalyst might change that sentiment ok

lr1l80,PLTR,-14.14%,$pltr extensive dd part what makes it disruptivevaluation,DD,401,0.91,Theeliteshitposter,244,yesterday i posted a lengthy dd on palantir technologies $pltr where i went indepth on my evaluation of the firms history its financials and why i believe the naysayers are wrong link included here i do recommend reading this first this post is meant to be a followupsupplement to my liking of this stock but i wanted to go more indepth into just why i find this company so special and unique as i mentioned in my dd last night i am just a yearold college student not an investment banker or hotshot market maker but i believe the information i have ascertained about palantir by just scouring the web distinguishes it from any company on the planet but well keep it strictly to the software industry in this dd what is truly unique about palantirs software gotham foundry apollo is how collaborative scalable and advanced it is let me break this down palantirs software is collaborative bc it meshes the companys clients data into a mega cloud for example the lapd bp jp morgan and top law firms all upload their data onto palantirs cloud where they can get insights into efficiency efficacy and receive suggestions from the advanced software on how to improve their venture these guys are all pltr clients btw and particularly useful for say defending an embassy or managing a supply chain now just to get it straight there is no datacloud that can come anywhere close to the insights and knowledge on what palantir has you might often hear from wall street research analystscnbc shills who complain that pltr has too many rich clients big companiesgovt but i think what boomers dont understand is that building your foundation amongst the biggest fish in the sea is quite the advantage not a weakness let me use an example from our beloved cathie wood and her firm ark invests large position in tesla extremely quickly i promise when asked about how she felt about teslas performance in the autonomous driving space compared to competitors like waymo owned by google she commented last year that having a vast collection of data would separate those who succeed from those who attempt as a reference tesla cars all transmit selfdriving data back to the firm which comes about through the many tesla owners who drive all over the world on the other hand waymo is committed to private testing stages only which is shallowminded bc it doesnt have access to trial data on say congested roads back to pltr the reason i bring up the waymoteslaark example is to highlight just how many clients pltrs revenue base represents and how impactful that is on a companys growth scalability and ultimately the success of their product but i mean when you think about it palantirs clientele is the entire global economysociety go to the financial times and try to find me an article that doesnt talk up palantirs greatness in the uk and their work helping nih eu members like greecefrance also use it for covid vaccine tracking palantir has contracts with the japanesesouth korean governments palantir has notably helped the us catch infamous cucks like osama bin laden to bernie madoff quite the diversity the reason for that entire bj to palantir right there is to illustrate just how extensive this scale is not only is all this data accessible right now to all these clients to collaborate on palantirs platform but is comprised of the single most dominant and sustainable institutionsenterprises in the world no matter how the political winds blow or how the globaldomestic economy winds up you can count on m the dod ferrari to name a few to continue seeking ways to scale grow expand and palantir certainly is the way this gets back to another central bulletproof thesis surrounding palantir who are its competitors who can do what palantir does lets start with snowflake all credit to their talented team warren buffett and their gang of bulge bracket banks who underwrote their ipo and cheerlead the stock on media outlets on the daily but for lack of a better word their software just isnt dope enough i mean the ui contrast speaks for itself but the intelligence is what matters here yes data warehousing is no joke and is certainly a scalable business but what kind of innovative insights can you draw from just essentially a digital warehouse that doesnt add any value all snowflake really is is salesforce dressed up in pretty bells and whistles really makes me question buffetts whole commitment to value cai at least has me interested it seems like a real knockoff version of palantir based on what i can ascertain from their public materials but so what a bunch of washedup junkies from oracle think they can lead the transition to ai compared to a company that was seeded in specifically to work with the cia and other intelligence agencies after pltr also called the gold standard by these agencies according to techcrunch why waste your time in cai or snowflake dont even get make me started on splunk ibm who conceded they suck by signing on w pltr last week or msft and while were at it lets talk about valuations to drive the point home according to the financial times pltr is valued at a $b market cap and is trading at x estimated sales to start yes that is very lofty even after accounting for the recent selloff due to earningslockup fears but ill pick on my prime targets snow and ai if we can even call them competitors well be nice snow has just under an $b market cap but is trading at x estimated sales ai is trading at a $b market cap and is trading at x estimated sales thats fucking crazy and buffett should sell snow immediately if he cares about value or he just doesnt understand technology since the whole speculation is going to be about earnings in the next few years lets talk about that as i mentioned in my dd yesterday pltr reported eps of $share on a nongaap basis which is triple what the street predicted but thanks to a $m stockholder compensation expense the gaap basis was a loss of $share and wall st took the opportunity to ambush pltr if you understand how business development works these incentives are necessary in the early stages of a company how else do you expect to attract top talent to the company and incentivize existing brains to stay but as you grow into your valuations like pltr will why do you need to do it pltr has essentially promised growth for years and earnings are on the way this year thanks to their earnings report who does apple need to incentivize to stay wall st is simply trying to make something out of nothing i also mentioned pltr was a directlisting yesterday unlike any of these other names here if you dont know what that means basically pltr didnt have its ipo underwritten by banks or pay them massive fees in the process so equity research investment banking asset management and other areas of lucrative finance have no incentive to talk up pltr just jeffries it seems for now and this is what i mean again as i mentioned yesterday it happens with all megacap tech companies think about it as evolution facebook apple tesla google microsoft these guys werent oversubscribed by the money makers either nor were they cheaply valued either but by the time the robust top line translated into earnings these firms were worth hundreds of billions of $ with the snap of your fingers which is exactly what will happen with palantir we are already seeing this their institutional ownership nearly doubled from in january to right now this is what i want you all to think about as a disclosure i am very long pltr you can view my positions on yesterdays dd but irregardless of whether you will invest in it or not read about palantir technologies this is the company of the future able to tailor its cuttingedge technology to all the intricate challenges the st century projects climate change further space exploration geopoliticalnuclear tensions renewable energy adoption inequality police reform and so much more while providing a platform for all these parties to collaborate and improve given the world is an ever expanding place and the dominant players are already seated at the table i could not feel more relieved or excited than to have all my chips in the one waiter who will serve them all this is not financial advice i recommend you read up on pltr pour through its financials and hear more from its ceo alex karp and chairman peter thiel then make your own informed balanced intelligent rational decision without a doubt this will be the company being discussed in the decades to come and i just want to expedite the conversation

lr4s0t,None,N/A,a treatise on the decline of western civilization and dollars why long bonds r fuk,DD,36,0.84,mattseg,118,tldr between inflation historically low rates a potentially overheating market ostensibly a bond bubble i believe long bonds r fuk and how to trade this for fun and profit inflation qe has been going on the better part of the last years another round of stimmys are set to go out soon and there is an assload of money pouring into stocks bonds digital assets metals and other asset classes there is enough money flying around to jack these all up and i categorically think the inflation number derived from cpi etc are total horse shit cpi is a lagging indicator and with half the dollars ever made being in the last like years its all looking pretty inflationary when the rubber meets the road and the velocity of money actually starts in the real economy its gonna look far worse i also believe that qe is trickle down economics by another name but this isnt a deadkennedysian punk rock manifesto that said inflation is a pressure on a number of asset classes one of which is bonds and their yields if the gov is selling bonds and the buyer believes the currency is being debased they are gonna want more yield rates rates r low as fuk they have been really low since and they got lower in the last year though they appear to be edging up yes this is to keep the economy going with cheap money and its mmt and japan and ecb did it but there has been a great deal of criticism of it and i dont believe its sustainable and this mixed with inflationary pressure also puts the dollar in a precarious spot where its falling out of favor as being a primary international currency of choice at least there are rumors and likely pressures on jpow and yellen about this many people far smarter than i which isnt saying much think that the market is on a melt up and one way to perhaps contain this fire is to raise rates to get a little money out of the market in a delicate way they have been doing this gingerly and so far successfully as the market hasnt gone full panic despite what i believe to be a market in the final stages of a melt up due to the cheap money i think jpow et al realize that things are pretty fucking precarious and properly adjusting rates is playing with tnt bond bubble a bunch of smart people are saying there is bond bubble i agree but the point of this section is that i sorta doubt its an explosive pop i have yet to find any historical precedent that is well researched of a government bond bubble pop not finding much on the one in the s of us treasuries but it may have happened so basically it exists but its not on its own seemingly likely to be a case where you wake up and things are fucking flying not like dot com beanie babies or grey market japanese used panties craze of then again maybe there arent as many speculators on bonds as there were in the other things bonds arent sexy maybe the money in bonds isnt as stupid and doesnt panic and blow shit up the way the others do the concerns for my thesis timing rates is over my pay grade im not a bond trader i never was a bond trader and aside from econ in college and some study materials for the series i know fuck all about bonds in a practical sense if the equity bubble maybe there is one maybe not pops first there may be a flight to safety in gov back securities which causes them to be bid up and thus not plummet if there is sufficient demand the fed may go more ham with qe and buy more long dated stuff and also try to go full on yield curve control folks have said there was a bond bubble since at least so maybe im wrong maybe qe and modern monetary theory are right maybe there isnt a bubble and rates can stay low forever and i really am as handsome as my mom says profit amp fun so if im right and please tell me if im not cause i appreciate input from the autists there are different ways to trade this the ways that are resonating with me are tlt puts and tbt tmv calls tbt and tmnt tmv have pretty low internal expense ratios and arent meant to degrade the same way more exotic stuff is so i dont think its the same sort of retardation that comes with people looking backwards at a chart of vxx and thinking itll go to million a share plus with all of these you can do options and as a degenerate gambler thats appealing to me ive been in this trade for about weeks now long dated puts and calls mostly leap calls on tbt at various strike prices under and i have about k in it now so its pretty yoloesque for a poor like me so far its been pretty rad my contracts are up between and and have gone up during the last week of whats been red for the bulk of my portfolio position is here sorry no charts cause im colorblind and i dont want to field questions about why the uptrend is purple and the down line is burnt sienna and its not longer cause my adhd is kicking in and wellbutrin that im on isnt as effective as adderall i realized i left out something important for those even less familiar with bonds than myself if rates go up value goes down so effectively the bet is to short bonds cause rates are gonna go up ampxb not that i need footnotes but ive been reading pretty heavily from jeremey grantham michael burry cathie wood jeffrey gundlach et al this is what i have divined from an array of inputs cause if i was that smart id probably be in a better station than posting this shit on reddit without figures in my

lrstmt,PLTR,-10.13%,explanation of pltr drop,DD,238,0.93,caducus,234,just in case some of you didnt realize heres why the drop on palantir has been so drawn out for over a decade palantir has insisted they wouldnt go public their private equity has been locked up and those employees saw no light at the end of the tunnel this created a very robust secondary market for their shares this exists for a ton of companies but palantir has been particularly strong offerings for blocks of shares would come up every few months for their private stock every year for ten years so a ton of stock is held by private individuals like myself who purchased it years ago via a secondary market and the process of getting that stock into our hands is a drawn out one we got when the stock first listed and that took about two weeks to fully reconcile this second round of people are allowed to sell started being released the day of as well about a week ago and is still running through the hoops of being released to all the buyers in effect the sell off started a week ago and really the anticipation of the release started things earlier and will likely continue for a week as investors continue to get access to their funds position shares at a cost of about $ a share no intention of selling once i actually have my hands on them,2021-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrstmt/explanation_of_pltr_drop/,1614142800
lrsylv,None,N/A,thoughts on copper as an inflation infrastructure green energy play,Discussion,18,0.58,larossmann,167,i am bullish on copper and id like a critique of my thesis when i used to work in the recording studio business back in it was well known that most people trying to start studios fail miserably there was always hype around a record label or some famous producer opening their new studio which would fail soon thereafter theyd have amazing platinum plaques and credentials but when they start their own place they fail horribly they often had more musical talent than managementbusiness talent and would faceplant also when normal people would see the success of one studio they want to start their own and reproduce it who wouldnt want to make their living recording cool music all day i was talking to someone who used to work at a place like sweetwater one of those venues that sells equipment to all of the wannabes something stuck with me that ill never forget they told me you dont make money off the dream of opening a studio you make money selling the dream of opening a studio sell the equipment the fiberglass for panels the preamps the console the high end tube u microphones the setup of the facility all that jazz regardless of whether the studio does amazingly well or fails entirely you made your money during a time of so many peoples home studio businesses recording people for cheap on craigslist failing so many professional studios failing retailers of the products necessary to set up said facility were doing amazing selling the dream generates more stable income than chasing the dream lets transfer that analogy to new infrastructure plans green energy startups solarev companies wind energy companies etc theres going to be an infrastructure plan regarding green energy coming out unless biden was fibbing about a t plan to tackle climate change which is hard to believe with a democratic house amp senate to try and guess which companies that will benefit when they will start making profit whether they will go tits up or do well and whether they are currently in a bubble thats too much for my small brain to try and time it is even harder is icln going back down to $ because its a bubble before it goes to $ when biden begins his t plan or is it going to $ before he announces it what car company will do best is tsla overvalued at its humble pe and about to get spanked by some surprise ford or gm comes out with or is tsla going to make pe the new norm by this time next year timing this and picking a company as well as when bubbles will burst is impossible i dont have the brain for it one thing is for sure every single one of them will need copper copper is an excellent conductor low resistance low oxidation cheap it doesnt matter whether the company makes billions or goes tits up it doesnt matter if a specific solar panel company makes great panels and sells record numbers or shit panels that all get recalled in order for them to even get started living the dream someone needs to sell them the commodities necessary to get started before they create much less sell a single marketable product they have to buy the copper we combine this with another tailwind the us dollar going to shit the dollar appears to be getting obilterated stimulus is going everywhere federal reserve balance sheet is exploding with seemingly no end in sight inflation occurs as a result of two things adding more to the money supply and a drop in production of goodsservices if huge swaths of entire industriesjobs are considered not essential by politicians for extended periods of time you have a loss in production if people get sick and cannot produce as a result you have a loss of production and if you have seemingly endless qe money printer go brrr means more money everywhere to buy up a limited number of goods and services the result is inflation i am seeing copper as a green energy inflation play that is less risky than speculating on any one particular company or fund as someone who believes inflation will get worse and that green energy is the future i think copper is a bullish play i am not quite sure the best way to take advantage of this if this is the case im more sharing this to get criticism amp ideas from others than to actually give advice i own shares of a few copper etfs right now and some icln at the time of this posting and am not trying to give advice but rather find holes in my thesis so i can make better investment decisions tldr my theory is that there is a triple decker event that will cause copper to soar more than it has and continue soaring is this a good investment thesis and if so how can i best capitalize on it reasons government subsidiesspending directed towards solarwindevclean energy companies causing a boom in demand of copper endless moneyprinting shortage of copper from the pandemiclockdowns pushing up the price of

lrdrsz,None,N/A,i am a roblox developer and i know the absolute fucking power it has,DD,3322,0.94,wddfrt,1348,note game developer i make games for fun and do not actually work at $sears not financial advice i have been seeing posts about $sears going public on march th and i am ecstatic because i truly believe that it will blow up i have been a part of the $sears community for quite some time and know all the ins and outs of how it works another person and i have developed $sears games that average a mediocre number of players in total during good times of the day let me tell you the games are absolute dog shit but people still play it and spend money on it it wasnt easy to make as scripting is quite hard and im retarded but the games are so bad yet children still play it ampxb wont be sharing what those games are for privacy reasons and dont know the extent of whether or not i can get in trouble ampxb how much i made in about the span of a month during christmas time cad ampxb as you can see that is a respectable amount of money considering i split the profits and havent updated the game in literal months kids spend stupid amounts of money on this platform you might be thinking that it isnt that impressive but oooh boy im just getting started but first let me get into the details of how $sears actually works because it doesnt seem like many people understand it ampxb how $sears works $sears makes money from people spending money on their membership called premium or from people buying their ingame currency called robux using the robux players can buy items from the catalogue whether its shirts gear or hatsaccessories they can also buy ingame powerups for different games everything is communitymade from the hats and accessories to shirts and games $sears used to be the only one able to make hats but recently has implemented a system where you can apply to be able to make hataccessory models $sears has made a few games for sponsorships but they are usually worse than the playermade ones now for how people make money $sears has a system called devex aka developer exchange where developers convert their robux into actual reallife currency the currency exchange rate is usdrobux there are some restrictions like not being able to exchange robux that was bought with your own money or not being able to exchange robux that was made from trading for more info visit basically when someone purchases something you made you get robux from it but $sears takes a predetermined of the robux spent and sends it into the void so that they dont have to pay you as much if you devex this number is usually $sears isnt just a game its an entire fucking economy $sears is interesting because unlike traditional online development you dont have to pay money to keep up servers you can make anything that you want granted that its not against tos for absolutely free now for the juicy stuff this will not only dwarf my puny numbers but will also show how big and how much bigger $sears is planning to be one thing that i have seen is people talking about how much top $sears developers make and the numbers are usually around k a month while it depends on how top you are talking about let me just give you an example of how much $sears developers make in a single $sears developer made million usd not only that but a single game has hit million concurrent players a single game i got all of this information from the $sears developer conference but thats not all from the conference from the conference we got a chart of milestones from $sears ceo david baszucki is trying to hit ampxb note that only the checkmarks mean that it has already happened thumbs up means that it is on track a funny one i saw was the tesla one i already know how much yall love sucking off tesla and elon they are also adding a website where you can hire scripters modellers and sound designers ampxb if you are interested i highly recommend that you watch the developer conference as there is so much stuff there that i cant put all into this post link statistically $sears is bigger than ever and is growing at a rapid rate ampxb ampxb ampxb another thing that is coming soon that will boost players is updates to the game development engine called studio $sears is constantly made fun of for having shitty games and granted thats not wrong but there are quite a few really good games out there that look pretty nice with the new updates coming games will look better than ever heres a look at what the new terrain materials and textures will look like they dont even look like $sears anymore and people wont be taking $sears as a joke ampxb ampxb ampxb because of this i believe that more and more people will look to get into game development on $sears and skyrocket its profits tldr $sears is growing at a rapid rate one person made million usd from developing $sears games in a year and $sears ceo david baszucki has huge aspirations for the company which is why i will be going balls deep into $sears stock when it goes public also i have no idea why everyones calling it $sears edit i now know why people are calling it sears and changed what i could

lrk5el,None,N/A,relief package and implications for stock market,Discussion,27,0.8,fzctungkun,146,edit pm i didnt expect this post would quickly turn into a debate about raising federal minimum wages to $ when i read the minimum wage clause i was thinking more along the lines of impacts to small and medium business and how that affects stock market performance of say dow jones small cap index somehow i did not include this thought in my original post or perhaps the relief bill is focused on providing assistance to the grassroot and therefore only tangentially related to the stock market i apologize if there is any confusion or unpleasant exchange all comments except those violating wsb rules are still welcome the biden administrations $ trillion relief package will be brought to the floors of house and senate soon and with democrats holding majority in both chambers there seems to be no issue passing it just want to have some discussion with fellow wsb investors about the impact of the package on stock market i understand that wsb is no political forum and i will try to make political discussions at the minimum but inevitably some gauging of the administrations pork barreling is needed some of my own thoughts the package seems to represent a pivot from the fed monetary policy to treasury fiscal policy as the center for economic relief and recovery the market seems a bit concerned that fiscal policy could trigger inflation that fed might gradually withdraw from asset purchases and that the fed might even be pressured to raise interest rates prematurely treasury yields shot up and institutional investors capitalized on it dumping equities in the past two days now i dont think fed will reduce asset purchases and suppress interest rates soon but the market is quite sensitive to any attempt that could be interpreted as trying to poke the “bubble” on the stock market i would expect more rollercoaster dramas in the coming weeks as more details of the bills are revealed the package is labeled as a “relief” bill and most of the media coverage ive read focuses on direct payments child support unemployment relief child tax credit etc but i am more concerned about what sectors could benefit from the bill the recent announcement of usps truck contract while not part of the package suggests the administration might use the package to send favors to specific sectors such as renewable energy and ev from what i read there are also supports for health insurance premiums and transit systems although i am not sure if that would have any substantial impact on relevant sectors i do agree that inflation could be a concern with such a big fiscal package and i am looking for good options to hedge against it one post ive seen suggest buying value stocks but i am suspicious as stocks are generally not considered hedging options i do buy physical silver and gold but i wonder if there are any better suggestions the package also includes a $ minimum wage clause and biden is trying hard to sell it all politics aside i am genuinely not sure if this would damage employment rate and offset all the unemployment and small business relieves in the bill i pledge ignorance on this issue and i await more enlightened views,2021-02-24,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lrk5el/relief_package_and_implications_for_stock_market/,1614142800

lrne4v,TSLA,-3.12%,a 🌈🐻 perspective on $tsla,Discussion,84,0.73,stbell13,125,long time lurker first time poster super 🌈🐻 on $tsla edit i forgot you guys cant read tldr short term 🚀🚀 long term big ⬇️ a good way to look at it is to increase in value tesla has to do everything right for years and still get lucky for the stock to go down they only have to fuck up once or maybe not even at all before i start let me make it clear that while i do eat crayons for breakfast lunch and dinner i am by no means an expert and this is hardly a serious dd like some others ive seen here before this is just my opinion and my take do what you will you beautiful retards also i like tesla and i respect them a lot i love that they made electric cars sxy and i want one but god damn if they arent insanely overvalued im betting against the stock not the company lets just start off with some easy facts you paste eaters can understand tesla right now is more valuable than basically every major car manufacturer lyft combined i love their cars but dude holy fuck you absolute apes drove this stock into the stratosphere and beyond so lets talk why this action today is expected natural and imo only sealing teslas fate towards reality first tesla was practically insolvent not that long ago elon even admitted as much here while they have done extremely well since then and have insane amounts of cash coming on hand especially q where they skyrocketed in cash on hand up to billion usd from $b this worries me more than encourages me why arent they spending this cash on future rampd efforts paying down debt making even more factories yes yes india i know but more charging stations battery tech or even give a bonus to all of their overworked laborers and employees that worked almost hour weeks nonstop despite coronavirus and rampant wildfires last summer to hit barely their delivery targets etc tesla already has mega churn because elonthe culture burns people out and a bonus would be super well received im sure nope they buy some digital currency you know the one look say what you will elon is a bit of a weirdo love him but man if he isnt unusual for a billionaire visionary and that move was definitely weird for a largeish corporation to do with so much money given theyre so young relatively unproven compared to other auto makers at least in the eyes of the boomer clan and looking to aggressively ramp up production to me it shows they dont have significant ideas for rapid future growth that they can realistically hit with that cash so theyd rather drive traffic to sales via well a meme that might be a genius move but its definitely nonstandard and doesnt speak to confidence in new development coming easily this means at least to me with tesla what you see is what you get they dont have any huge surprises coming or new products lurking that we havent already heard about robotaxi lol $k car etc they dont have a huge pipeline of new tech ready to roll out and they arent aggressively rolling funding into even further development to not only stay ahead of the giants that are creeping up but to run past them and push farther ahead ford bmw mercedes audi porsche etc all have evs on market this year and all have significantly more infrastructure and capital on hand to shift to meet the growing ev demand theyre behind but not for long they may be slow giants but they didnt get there for free and they have been there that long for a reason finally ev is the future for now but what if in five years its hydrogen or fucking fusion or maybe even some bad stuff happens with ev and everyone wants ice again tesla is super exposed to one industry while the giants have their feet in both pools at once might make them slower but its also less risk and theyre not that slow seeing as theyre already on the market it is legitimately retarded to count those automakers out at that point just roll your k into robinhood second lets talk tesla fundamentals ish im not gonna dig into the numbers and financials because i am a moron and i dont know how what i am gonna talk about is the business compared to their peers here is what tesla currently sells and bulls say they are going to be insanely profitable from cars duh solar roofsolar wall robotaxis eventually insurance eventually semis eventually people like to lump batteries in here as some sort of profit saving thing but it really might not be maybe maybe not time will tell and ill talk about that in a second cars duh teslas are dope as hell they have had their issues in the past but theyre sick and people want them demand is there for sure and growing rapidly i wont deny but others are catching up just as fast as the market is shifting towards ev meaning when the old crusty ass mfs who dont know whats an electricity decide they want an ev they will have significantly more choice as consumers than you or i today if we were to go car shopping this will undoubtedly pull away from tesla sales you can assume that tesla somehow magically doesnt lose any interest in a field with increasing competition but this just isnt reality people like new things and companies that make new good cars will see sales tesla is that right now will they be that in the future im not certain see production scaling concerns above to really assume they wont lose any consumer interest despite growing competition theyd need to be pumping out multiple different models im talking a non cyber tesla truck some sort of hatchbacksport crossover maybe even an adventure sport rig like an ev runner or the ev hummer thats coming out americans like big cars its a fact just because its an ev and saving the planet doesnt mean consumers want to sacrifice this is why tesla was and has been successful because they finally made an ev that wasnt fugly as shit and a laughing stock but if they dont continue to drive innovation into existing ice sectors with ev tech theyre going to get left behind tesla is gonna want to capture this market share and they havent even hinted at it so far i dont know specific numbers and i dont think anyone legitimately does so take everything you read with a grain of salt but tesla isnt going to be leaps and bounds ahead of competitors in the future ev sphere unless they really buck up if anything by not doing these things now theyre backing themselves into a corner and a specific look that might be hard to shake later next solar things solar wall and roof are dope but theyre not cheap and pretty niche right now it requires living in an area with enough sunlight and being able to afford them in the first place theres also just not a ton of consumer demand for this right now we could see a huge consumer shift towards personal responsibility for green energy in which case this stuff may become ultra profitable but its still a matter of scale i dont know their production numbers but with how little ive heard about it i dont think theyre huge and if demand spikes they wont be in a great place to capture it if they arent scaling appropriately see cash concerns above now lets talk robotaxis and insurance insurance is a dud thats not big money maybe im not just a retard but also an idiot but i truly dont think tesla offering insurance does anything positive for their bottom line the way i understand the proposition is that because theyre so confident in their selfdriving tech they would become your insurance company insuring you if fsd made any mistakes this is a lot of liability forrrr nothing they cant really take payments for it unless its well below what consumers pay now for insurance otherwise are they really so confident about their tech if thats the case insurers will drop rates and lay off employeesclose locations to meet those rates because a they like money and b its even easier money than now if theyre less likely to pay out at a certain point teslas insurance is more just a warranty than anything seriously profitable for tesla they take on a lot of risk and can only really do this once a certain number of autonomous vehicles are on the road to ensure their liability isnt too high and after regulatory bodies have been coerced into approving this otherwise theyre taking on a lot of risk for basically no gain robotaxis are equally dudish again maybe im just a fucking mouth breathing smooth brained ape but people like people even though people bitch about other people everyone bitched about being insideaway from society during rona and never seeing anyone some people like those random interactions you get with a real person and some people just truly dont trust robots both of these take away from potential customersmarket share tesla is likely to see from robotaxis also old people and tech dont generally mix getting better but still old people and robots likely wont be a hot seller further regulation and the required insurancewarrantycoverage whatever for this whole operation wont be quick or cheap what happens when someone has a heart attack or passes out asleep or faints in your robotaxi what happens if it does happen to get in an accident or if it gets a flat tire what happens if the address is wrong or someone needs to change where theyre going what if they have a thick accent and the vehicle doesnt respond or what if they arent a native speaker or are disabled mute deaf blind need assistance getting into trunk or intoout of car how do these situations get handled finally not everyone wants to have random people in their car especially without supervision what if someone trashes your car or pissesshitspukes in there while theyre drunk sure tesla or whoever might cover you but robotaxis wont clean themselves further what about charging the cars wont charge themselves after theyre done with their shift so unless youre able to go out and plug it in what happens if charge is too low for you to then drive home guess you gotta wait not saying its impossible just that there are a lot more factors that need to be addressed before this is a slam dunk and heres the kicker its not even a super profitable industry uber is operating at a loss and theyre the defacto millennial ride calling service lyft and yellow cab still exist among a host of other ride sharing services especially abroad in places like asia europe is much more walkable imo so its not as popular from what ive seen but in major cities london sure it still is overall robotaxis arent really gonna be the future unless a fuckload of good shit happens for tesla and basically every boomer suddenly loves robots plus if everyone has a tesla who the fuck is riding in the robotaxis even if you assume somehow tesla starts being like usps or amazon and delivering packagesgroceriesbecomes a god damn short bus there still will be competitors and its still not as easy as saying but its the future semis i dont know shit about shit here but i havent heard much more than a peep about this so im naively assuming its not a huge corner of teslas business projections for the future maybe tesla becomes the daimler of ev and sells only big ass ev semis but i doubt it i dont see this being a huge money maker perhaps im very wrong lastly batteries lots of people like to say how teslas batteries are gonna make them tons of money and much better than their competitors blah blah but i dont really buy this their tech may be really good now but other companies with a lot more money and history of development are coming hard for the money in the ev sphere i dont want to assume that these companies will necessarily make their own battery tech but someone will people like money a lot if these companies dont figure out how to build their own batteries like tesla someone will and here is where teslas battery strategy becomes not super useful tesla paid a fuck load upfront in capital expenditure to finance and develop factories to make these batteries if another company starts making batteries that are even remotely comparable to teslas they will likely end up a lot cheaper eventually not immediately because they will begin producing en masse to support allllll the other ev makers standardizing in the process no less not just the batteries tesla needs and if that never happens it means the ev makers made their own which means they are confident enough in their own costperformanceetc and tesla really isnt that far ahead i know tesla has a big advantage here now but that doesnt mean people who worked on tesla batteries wont go work elsewhere for more money and it doesnt mean these other companies wont hire young and hungry masters and phd grads to develop cutting edge battery tech straight off of their full ride to yale in fact that tech is probably already being developed in ivy league labs for fun by those exact types of people for their phd and professors using their grant and research money hell some boy scout in a garage in iowa might be doing it right now tesla may be a leader now counting on them to stay dominant and leaps and bounds ahead forever is not just foolish but stupid everyone buying in and hoping for this stock to go to $ is either completely braindead irretrievably stupid or not paying any attention whatsoever theyre assuming tesla is operating in its own little quarantine zone where nobody ever competes with them and theyre the golden child forever look i like tesla but no matter what endeavor they go after someone else is gonna go for it too tesla may end up being better at it but that doesnt make them insanely profitable off the rip and it doesnt mean everyone will use teslas stuff some people dont like the brand some people dont like elon others may just like other stuff more finally look at the anatomy of a bubble and compare it to teslas stock chart its shockingly similar i know i know thats moronic but im a moron and a 🌈🐻 so what can i say the other eerily similar chart and comparable situation is radio corporation of america circa radio was hot new shit and everyone thought it was the fuckin future dude so shares skyrocketed and everyone hopped in but oopsie turns out radio wasnt the paradigm shifting thing everyone thought it would be and stock prices tanked this has happened with every bubble ever everyone thinks theyre invincible everyone thinks this time is different everyone thinks the institutions know their shit and are never wrong ever cathie wood ähem ähem but every single time theyve been proven wrong fundamentals always matter and tesla aint there chief finally graham dodd buffet some of the most legendary investorsinvesting advice people ever whose advice has withstood many many decades and market conditions warn about buying at any price assuming the stock will continue to increase so no matter where you buy in youll make money this sound familiar how about those ludicrous price targets of $share sound reasonable unless tesla fundamentally shifts the way we as a society think about and approach transportation as a whole and i dont just mean ice to ev retards their valuation is completely temporary and entirely fucked theres a few catalysts that i can think of as well some bearish some bullish for some bullish ones uk announced uber has to treat drivers like employees not contractors meaning their profits will be hurt this does mean good news for robotaxis if and only if they can actually make them work profitably further loosid dont think i can say this name here is going public and rivian is slated to go public this year as well if these companies or nkla or nio or some other companies have significant and public blunders tesla stands to gain however some bearish catalysts are that those other companies are coming and if they dont fuck up theyre just more competition in an increasingly crowded space more choices means less profits for tesla also in case you guys forgot tesla is a pretty shitty company in terms of workers rights they dont offer ks and they have been staunchly antiunion further elon basically forced people back to work during the pandemic and reopened the factories early despite governmental orders and fired employees for not coming back into the office after having stated publicly they could remain at home he might not have been directly involved in this but tesla sure was while those have already eclipsed it isnt a promising outlook for the future and the breakneck speeds workers are being pushed to meet along with long hours to meet delivery targets are going to be very hard to maintain if they see worker fatigue and dropout im not saying theyre gonna miss targets but there is a chance that workers unionize or otherwise strikerebel and want more representationcompensationwork life balance this would reduce delivery targets and decrease profit margins further with a democratic party leading all branches and pretty activist voices in some pretty powerful positions companies like amazon and tesla that dont treat workers well may see legalpunitive backlash from the government if they dont change things themselves i for one would be popcorn meme watching aoc and elon duke it out on twitter over something like this also tesla is opening a new factory in india and there are factories in china but these might not be as great as people think india is in a lot of turmoil right now with the farmers revolt and there are some serious issues with the government there along with china and the uighurs i would be not too surprised to see some sort of governmental sanctions or tightened restrictions on trade until these countries resolve those issues which could spell bad news for tesla these countries are great new markets but like the usa they also have their own car manufacturers and other ev players tesla isnt going to have a monopoly anywhere so chill the fuck out so all of this paints my pretty grim picture for teslas stock price but heres where i do my retard math if you look at yahoo finance for teslas book value you get like $share this takes into account all of teslas assets and liabilities now tesla could take on more liabilitiesdebt in order to fund more rampd and drop their book value by doing so but heres the thing they have like $b cash on deck to do that and they havent i dont see them taking out massive loans that havent been normal business procedure for them in the coming years so take this book value and assume they grow at a rate of year over year for years straight which would be fucking insane this gives you like $share book value now lets look at their peers and their sector ev as a whole is in a bubble imo so i dont think its really legitimate to compare to their ev peers ev is the tech bubble tesla is the specific stock issue in question affected most heavily because of namebrand recognition so compared to companies that have made cars longer than you or i have been alive toyota vw bmw honda daimler suzuki ford gm the average price to book ratio of those companies is teslas is if you take the insane growth figure i listed before which represents yoy true growth in the company averaged out over the years to reduce any weirdness with new debt reducing book value and you add on a increase of the pb ratio so raw compared to their peers this assumes theyre more pricey than their closest competitors after insane growth for the next five years meaning were assuming basically fucking everything above goes right for tesla and you price all of that in today you get a value of $share tesla is almost double that today in my opinion teslas true value lies around $share with an assumption of yoy growth of book value years in a row and a increase of pb relative to peer average tesla is the pb sector leader with this factor added on you get $share if you wanna be bullish and assume more goes right and things turn out better call it $ or $ this book value and its growth expectation wraps in things like profit margin and other fun little gotchas a lot of tesla bulls like to point to saying how tesla is supreme and much better than companies like toyota which literally fucking created lean manufacturing its called the toyota way that transformed not just auto manufacturing but any industry that remotely has anything to do with manufacturing in general put up against that tesla may be a maverick but they have some big fucking shoes to fill and stiff competition anything more than $share and i think youre truly ignoring fundamentals and living in fantasy land like every other bubble occupant in the history of the stock market and human history so where does that leave us today well michael burry despite being pretty crazy is actually pretty brilliant and has been skepticalshort on tesla long before i decided to jack myself to the tits quantity wise not so much cost on cheap premie puts i dont think anyone can truly time a bubble and the actions that the fed has been taking along with upcoming stimulus checks and tax returns could prolong any top well beyond its natural range i could get totally fucked because of this but whatever i didnt throw in more than i can afford to lose so whatever happens happens plus as a 🌈🐻 id probably deserve it anyways the selloff that has happened over the past week i believe is the start of the blowoff phase were on the way down now its just a matter of how long it can hang on imo the big dip yesterday was our local bottom until we ramp back up to the back to normal section if youre long tesla personally id sell there i do think short term there are some decent gains to be had if you buy now and hold for a week or two im not an expert but im guessing in about a week or two were back up near $ and thatll be about the peak after that i think the stock loses steam and drops off to its natural level wherever that ends up being between $ and $ if you listen to analysts really insightful shit really narrows it down the bounce back today for me has more just confirmed the shape of the bubble and reactionary tendencies that people are pretty predisposed to and kind of just confirms that the movement is based more on sentiment and human psychology than true fundamentals i might be wrong about the timing but im as close to certain as ive ever been about a stock that this is going to go to sub $ levels in the next year if im right im buying a tesla positions lots of puts at different sub $ strikes planning on buying more cheap otm short term puts every month until this stock goes down or i go bankrupt sadly was

lrdg2q,None,N/A,gsat dd its the spectrum stupid,DD,257,0.95,industrial_trust,213,this is all off the top of my head but its a basic outline of why i think gsat is a big deal there are a lot of people who understand the company better than i do but i really think this is worth looking seriously at and its up a little bit today so heres my first stab at dd be advised im not a sat com expert nor is this investment advice and i really have no idea what im doing here also i should say price targets for gsat range wildly ive seen targets over $ per share floated around with some pretty impressive analysis behind it but more conservatively im in line with suggestions it could be $$ if and when all goes well in a very optimal scenario and it seems theres a much broader consensus on a $ to $ target in the near term gsat owns c band and s band spectrum which with the push to g and internet of things has suddenly become incredibly valuable recent fcc auctions will attest to this for years gsat was waiting for fcc authorization on that spectrum but by the time they got it they had issues with debt and investors were wary to jump in without a clear monetization plan for their spectrum the heavy debt situation has since been resolved giving them enough of a cash runway to continue in for the next three years their business model during most of the past decade involved satellite phones and gps tracking which with their aging satellites and limited market for that kind of stuff was never meant to do much more than keep the lights on while they waited for the value of their spectrum to appreciate their share price languished under $ for a long time until when a couple things started to shift they partnered with nokia to set up a secure redundant g node for the port of seattle with more similar collaborations likely down the line then most recently qcom announced that their x next generation snapdragon modem which is the most popular smartphone modem in the world will connect to the n band specifically gsat owns this band of spectrum nobody else qcom obviously did that for a reason but as of now theres no widespread usage of that spectrum as its not really being used except by gsat spot devices and phones which is to say hardly at all exactly what that means for gsat is unclear but what it does mean is that within a few years millions of devices around the world will have the ability to connect to their spectrum theres a lot of dd out there breaking down price targets but the truth is nobody knows and the ceo and other execs have shown an incredible amount of patience and personal investment in terms of allowing their spectrum assets to appreciate while putting their own money on the line to keep things afloat over the years starlink atampt verizon should all be interested in buying and have probably all made offers or overtures but gsat has not bitten even when they needed the money which also suggests that the company is not interested in a sale and indeed leasing the spectrum might be far more lucrative than an outright sale and better for shareholders i wont bother describing the different possible monetization strategies here as ive linked to a report published by nokia at the bottom of this post that does a much better job than i could gsats spectrum is sometimes compared to a large swath of undeveloped beachfront property in the middle of south beach completely clean and unsullied in the middle of an increasingly crowded and frenzied space they look like a penny stock at first glance but they are far from it and it may be the ultimate g play you might ask what about musks starlink arent they going to eat gsats lunch edit this is better addressed in a comment by usquishjonesjr starlink use ku band for their user terminal links and ka for the gateway links they wont need any spectrum in cband also doubt they would purchase spectrum to ensure others cant use it their main focus is not going bankrupt their initial constellation will cost $b and could be much higher if more sats are needed filed for up to k sats not to mention their gen sats have a useful life of years so they will have to replace those soon after service start usquishjonesjr starlink probably doesnt need gsat spectrum and for our purposes gsat is not really in competition with starlink as their current business model which will be affected by starlink is not the source of the stocks theoretcal valuation but if someone did want to compete with starlink they would need to access gsat assets which is another reason why starlink might need to get there first not because they need it but because they dont want anyone else to have it starlink is a possible buyer for gsat not for their satellites but for their spectrum the value of gsat is not in its satellites or the ground units its in the spectrum dish is another possible buyer for gsat some people point to debt issues with gsat its true the company has diluted its shares quite a bit to remain solvent over the years but they currently have enough cash on hand to give them a three year runway it would make zero sense for another offering to occur before a major monetization event for the spectrum and since this is g that monetization event is going to happen well before they run out of cash another issue often raised “the fcc can just seize spectrum and reallocate it if they want thats what happened to insert late s early s sat company here these other companies from what i understand had major issues with solvency and so they basically went to the fcc to see what kind of deal they could get if they surrendered it to be reallocated btw ive learned that the correct way to talk about spectrum is not as something that gsat owns or holds but as something they currently control seems risky betting on the value of globalstar spectrum was a risky play but now that qcom has legitimized the value of the n band albeit not explicitly or specifically in terms of eventual use case by including it in the next gen snapdragons connectivity ability the risk associated with the play has diminished a great deal the bear case of the qcom aspect of all this is that including n connectivity is more of a marketing trick than something they imagine will actually get used but given that n is extraordinarily underutilized at this point even that scenario implies that qcom expects to see expanded usage of that band in the short term also i thought it was interesting that nokia would publish this on their website from nokia “nokia customer globalstar inc a us based provider of mobile satellite voice and data services is in the enviable position of having ghz spectrum that works everywhere meaning it has been globally allocated ghz spectrum is in the sweet spot from a physics perspective because its good for both coverage and capacity although its not yet a gpp standardized spectrum band it has been approved by the federal communications commission and recently in other countries its remarkably clean meaning its clear has no cochannel interference and provides network benefits for both indoor and outdoor deployments globalstar turned to nokia to help determine the band characteristics for its available spectrum and identify potential application options nokias network planning and optimization npo team conducted a small cell network study of globalstars ghz spectrum as compared to a similar hetnet network in ghz the study proved the versatility of globalstars spectrum showing that operators with a small cell network could benefit from globalstars clean spectrum while those without small cell networks could benefit from its huge capacity in our study globalstars spectrum outperformed outdoor small cell deployments by while requiring less infrastructure for indoors in an urban office environment we were able to deploy approximately half the access points required since the band has no interference from macro towers operating in the same frequency the full report can be seen here the team went a step further to also provide six business model options for globalstar to consider “we were excited to work with nokias npo experts to help determine how to best monetize and maximize the use cases of our spectrum asset so we can deliver the highest quality experience to the end users” said jay monroe chairman and ceo of globalstar ways to monetize amp maximize the spectrum lease the spectrum to incumbent operators – this provides extra capacity for operators and uses their own ran equipment and services operators can use clean spectrum without incumbrance and it supports standard capabilities like carrier aggregation roaming and redirection for globalstar this is a simple revenue model without any operational burdens dedicated inbuilding small cell spectrum – the analysis clearly shows the difficulties presented by macro interference to small cell deployments offering a dedicated clean spectrum band would dramatically improve the performance of these hetnets and significantly reduce the cost to deploy them globalstar could lease the spectrum to one carrier nationwide or carriers in geographic regions that wanted to reduce the strain on their expensive macro tower infrastructure use the spectrum as a satellite service enhancement – by deploying rans in globalstars high use areas such as air terminals shipping ports military bases or cargo handling facilities globalstar can both provide satellite offload and support high data rates and advanced applications enhanced services are provided to customers where they normally congregate and for these customers there is a layer of satellite redundancy in the event of disruptions in terrestrial networks lease spectrum for private lte systems to noncarriers – cable companies are increasingly interested in pursuing wireless services themselves globalstars spectrum provides an opportunity to add a private lte network on top of their dense cable plant alternatively as the inbuilding networks are further developed there may be an opportunity to include globalstars band as a private lte service on top of neutral host models directly provide private services to enterprises – by offering private lte systems directly to enterprises globalstar provides spectrum equipment and services to end user customers which provides direct control over the user experience and maximizes private lte system revenue opportunities these deployments of globalstars spectrum could be done while several of these other options are pursued simultaneously mass market product enablement licensing – globalstar could license spectrum to odm manufacturers for use in mass market this would include unrestricted use and products distributed globally this option could address the internet of things or connected car markets no matter what globalstar decides to do nokia will be there to partner with them – in the us and around the world we are also lending our support to the gpp standardization process and equipment manufacturing enablement which are critical for the spectrums

one and only reason why you have to charge your phone every hours and your tesla who doesnt have one these days after km lets not forget a batterys purpose is to stores energy the more energy you can store in a smaller battery the happier we humans are energyhappiness finding a costeffective and efficient solidstate battery for electric vehicles could prove equivalent to finding the golden fleece in greek mythology according to the legend anyone who possessed the golden fleece would be considered a true ruler according to the present technology anyone who could develop a costeffective and efficient solidstate battery would rule the ev world a few listed companies are working on revolutionary solidstate batterys instead of liion solidstate batteries use solid electrodes and solid electrolytes for the ones who never heard about these use opera or google to dyor solidstate batteries promise already today twice the energy th of the size x faster charsing x longer lifetime nonflammability this new piece of thcenturytechnology will definitely evolve coming years elon musk already called it the moab now lets talk stocks a few companies are working on a solidstate battery expecting to bring it to the market within a few years today much of the development work on solidstate batteries is performed with partnerships among the players are conventional liion batterycell manufacturers ie samsung sdi lg chem a systems battery separator technology solutions suppliers asahi kasei and materials suppliers solvay umicore etc quantumscape panasonic samsung lg ionic materials bmw solid power toyota ilika according to yole développements market forecast mass production of solidstate batteries will begin by and represent less than of liion battery demand by this might explain the relative low interest from investors today which might change when large solidstate battery manufacturing capacities start to be built samsung lg bmw etc are all searching for the solidstate battery for own use so that is not interesting for me to invest in they already reached their market share today there are stocks i want to discuss with you quantumscape and ilika you might have heard about quantumscape before qs went to the moon $ $ when volkswagen announced it took an extra stake in the battery manufacturing company crazy times on the stock market back in the days now qs is stable between $ $ fair price for a company with no revenue but a huge potential in the ev market qs is already backed by $ million worth of investment from volkswagen bill gates and hedge fund billionaire george soros ilika is also a pioneer in solid state batteries trading around $$ ilika has has two development programs stereax miniature batterys for medtech goliath solidstates for the ev and other batterypowered transportation the scope of growth is huge in both industries compared to qs and to see whats happening with their stocks lets only focus on the ev market ilika aligned a road map where the plan to start production of the solidstate battery in thats the same period as the planning of qs ilika actually plans a prepilot this year and a construction pilot in for more information dyor so why is ilikf trading $$ and qs $$ founded by stanford university scientists a decade ago with financial backing from volkswagen ag quantumscape became a public company in november after merging with kensington capital acquisition corp a specialpurpose acquisition company spac when the spac deal was announced in september the parties decided a $ billion valuation was appropriate following a blistering stockmarket run quantumscape is now worth more than times that initial value those who bought shares in the kensington spac in august have enjoyed a return quantumscapes prominent backers include venture capital firms khosla ventures and kleiner perkins microsoft inc cofounder bill gates hedge fund billionaire george soross quantum partners and investor jeremy grantham jb straubel a former chief technology officer at tesla is on the board these people know how to bring a company to the market and make it moon $$$ looking at their financials and progress qs and ilika do not differ that much they both have enough capital to fund the business processes for the next years and both planning to bring their product to market in to understand the difference we have to look in the type of investors of both companies and their strategy for production the difference is qs plans to build a gigafactory to manufacture their batteries which asks for a huge investment billion – million per gwh that is the real reason why they are raising these amounts of capital ilika has chosen a different route they will use the uk battery industrialisation centre ukbic as a first step before scaling up through an existing manufacturing company to get to the gwh ukbic is a key part of the faraday battery challenge fbc a government programme to fast track the development of costeffective highperformance durable safe lowweight and recyclable batteries therefor ilika doesnt need the same capital investment to fund their growth so here is the point solidstate battery technology is the future of battery ilika is growing in multiple industries including the ev market therefor i believe ilike is a save and good investment for the long term what are your

ls3ktz,U,-12.01%,unity for the crazy or for the tanks game developer pov $u,Discussion,38,0.86,CrazyTanks,52,so here ill gonna bring my worthless pov on unity but first of all a minute background unity is a game engine which is the most important infrastructure of game making before game engines appeared game developers had to calculate every stupid pixel on the screen by themselves then a lot of wrappers appeared opengl etc and after that the game engines the game engine allows the developer to connect the code graphics music physics and basically everything together most of the large companies develop and use their own game engines but as far as i concern the only public known large and practically adopted by developers are unity and unreal engine well back to that shortly ampxb lets get back to unity as a game developer also mldl but who cares ive used many frameworks and game engines for more than years hell i even used dark basic when i was young and i can say that unity is the only time i felt at home now i know you dont give a shit about my experience so lets talk business the good stuff unity solves one of the major problems of native growth in game making and thats a fully cross platform engine that means that i can develop once and my stupid stuff would work pc android ios xbox playstation virtual reality web you got the idea that work of being cross platform is insanely hard which means there is a huge leap to create a competing product even the best open source game engines have a very limited amount of devices they support which means that as a developer an open source game engine might be a risk for me in terms of growth and future support tldr cross platform unity got a huge asset store which is a crazy source of revenues from stupid developers like me that means that even if im totally not profitable unity might have some revenue from me without investing a penny or a minute of support team the huge asset store makes it very easy for new developers to do their first steps in the platform and like maya vs dsmax or nikon vs canon the first one youve touched is gonna be the only one youll know tldr easy step in huge asset store revenues even from nonprofitable games next the future game industry is growing and we all know it but what unity got that it would outperform the market glad youve asked they got everything unity supports machine learning infrastructures which can be connected easily to many application well thats too general right so let me put it like that years to the future self driving cars are more and more popular and regulated when you regulate it you also have to test it digitally unity is one of game engines that practically gonna be available for that task virtual reality is also a trend guess how most developers develop for it also it might enter the movie industry and stuff like that tldr tons of room to grow vr algorithms and algorithms testing as ive mentioned unity got only one real competitor epic which got unreal engine that does basically the same epic are not public but hopefully will but currently unity is just the only exposure to this kind of product if i had to choose i would just put my happy hippos on both tldr no publicly traded competitors lastly unity can grow without a single phone call there is no major difference for unity to support k users or m just like google or facebook if we compare it to companies like ttow nintendo and even xboxmicrosoft and oculus facebook they all had to invest ton of money for content creation and physical platform making tldr unity have to spend almost $ for each new user ampxb now for the bad stuff unity price was very high how much high at the pick unity passed ea in terms of market cap thats high its currently at discount right now and it still might considered high but do notice its around more than ipo day pltr fore example is already multiplied i think they were out on the same day tldr high price whatever that means another bad thing unity had relatively bad quarter their revenue went up but they earnings were still negative why is that well first of all theyve something like shares which is like m$ thats exactly the margin they needed to publish a profitable quarter you know what that means for the next one tldr last quarter was good revenues but bad earnings mostly due to stupid reasons as ive mentioned large companies generally use their own game engines thats a lot of money the currently unity miss lastly epic might go public sooner or later it wont be a surprise if $u would go down some percents at the same day but for the long run etfs would buy both of the stocks like arkarkk did with unity and that would bring the price up tldr their only real competitor might go public sooner or later thats it if you survived everything tell me what you think for me i think ill just buy the dip and hold forever since the growth is crazy and the world just getting more and more digital but please do your math since no one know whats gonna be disclaimers i know nothing about nothing im not an investment advisor and dont take any advice from me or in general dont just listen to a random stupid guy on the internet and all that read about it yourself im just a developer that enjoy and know to appreciate the platform and its cross platform abilities for my

you can check his profile for his dd my humble street cred when $bb was undervalued $ i wrote a ddclick me literally premoon launch and made the forest grump bb meme so i hope this gives me some retard street credits so lets start right now we are in a bloated market with some insane valuations inflation fears and recession nightmares so intuitively the plays which would make most sensewithstand all of these are undervalued stocksrare gems in an overvalued market i introduce to you ticker $f ford 🇺🇸 🦅 the all american car manufacturer which withstood every recession since s the company which our government treats as a favorite child the car manufacturer which produced most american cars ever and finally the innovator which employs one of the greatest pr firms and rampd teams i know i know you may say wtf ford gtfoh boomer hear me out till the end and youd be surprised ford is storming the electrical vehicle market and they arent fucking around veni vidi vici yes you read the tittle right not only that but also they are targeting middle class value buyers high quality cheap ev cars to compete with tesla after years of development this year they came out with mache an ev car which has a starting price of $after federal tax credit which still applies to ford evs indicates great government connections and easily rivals a model y when it comes to value its way cheaper and has relatively comparable features as the verges sean okane perfectly said i dont think people should underestimate just how important the mustang mache could be the mustang branding makes it instantly familiar and the design is striking enough that it gets noticed right away without being so out there that its uncomfortable or weird or alien its the kind of car that in a couple of years if enough of them are on the road it can really make people take notice and think about buying an electric car in a way that the ipace or the audi etron or the chevy bolt never have or will i think ford is tapping into something only tesla really does well right now with the mache which is trying to mix that modern design with increasing ubiquity in a way that could make people feel like theyre missing out on something much like the effect a new iphone can have for more on mach e comparison to tesla cars link link what about production constant need for innovative technology in evs and the need for other models productionkeep all of the following in mind because a tesla comparison is ahead ford produces around million cars per year its the second biggest us car manufacturer they know the ins and outs of the car production market and have top tier international connections additionally and more importantly they have the government in their pocket ford has active production facilities in turkey china romania spain india canada germany south africa thailand russia taiwan argentina england venezuela mexico brazil and slovakiaarranged by size but im not here here today to talk about that ill be focusing on the ev car production ford has already produced maches and they delivered of them to dealers in addition they are planning to produce maches this year while this number may seem minuscule in comparison to the six figure production number of their gas vehicles its an impressive start in the ev market by comparison this year so far tesla has rolled out and sold just of its electric suvs the model x and back in the ev manufacturer was able to produce only of its popular model s in the first six months of production the following year however tesla delivered more than model s while tesla had a slow start it certainly has caught up in filling customer orders in its averaged sales of model s a month or about cars a year while ford wont be able to match this years tesla sale numbers initially it looks as if its off to a strong start source motor biscuits another point to keep in mind other carmakers havent had as an impressive showing as tesla in ev production either jaguar sells a mere ipaces a month the audi etron a plugin suv is averaging about sales a month as for the chevrolet bolt its sales numbered about to date this year the chevy evs first year saw only producedmotor biscuits and please dont get me started on chinese ev bs bottom line is aside from tesla production numbers in the ev space ford is the next runnerup after tesla what about international production and sales ford to go all electric in europe by it intends to spend $ billion to revamp a factory in cologne germany where it will produce evs using a volkswagen platformbiggest car manufacturer in europe this new strategy involves phasing out gasolinepowered vehicles in favor of electric power the automaker expects to have all commercial vehicles made by ford in europe be electric by two years later it expects to have converted its entire lineup into electric or plugin hybrids gasolinepowered commercial vehicles will still be offered for sale in europe after ford says however the automaker currently sees electric models accounting for twothirds of its european salessource tech crunch what about asia ford announced jan that its mustang mache suv will be manufactured by changan ford for customers in china the mustang mache will start being produced there later this year as it looks to tap into chinas electric vehicle ev market remember that china is the worlds biggest car market with more than m vehicles sold each year bbc what about government support in production ford ceo calls on us government to support ev batteries chargingheadline on feb reuters he outlined the automakers plan to develop electric platforms for its topselling trucks vans and suvs what happened after that biden ordered for a review of us supply chains for vital goods such as large capacity batteries and semiconductors in addition he signed an executive order to amend the semiconductor shortage it seeks $ billion in funding legislation as a shortfall of semiconductors has forced us automakers and other manufacturers to cut productionreuters innovation and technology ford and google to accelerate auto innovation reinvent connected vehicle experience feb ford link ford and google came together in firstofitskind partnership to create unique services and capabilities for ford and lincoln customers and to accelerate fords transformation plan they are working on data artificial intelligence ai and machine learning ml innovations as part of this new sixyear partnership millions of future ford and lincoln vehicles at all price points will be powered by android with google apps and services builtin in addition ford and google have established a collaborative group called team upshift that will push the boundaries of fords transformation unlock personalized consumer experiences and drive disruptive datadriven opportunities what other ev models are they working on in the ford fseries was second only to the apple iphone which raked in $ billion in terms of total revenue generated the fseries generated more revenue than the nfl mlb nba and the nhl combined which added up to $ billion just something to think about the fseries is their most successful car and they are planning to release the new ev version of it soon this year after that they will move to electrify almost every model one by one valuation and price target $ $m market

here as you can see this is crazy and retarded at the same time take any of the stocks above and compare it to $f itll always come out undervalued relatively speaking for the people who are trying to justify these bs valuations dont lie to yourselves your business degree doesnt work in this market meta these highly speculative valuations are built on retail investor hype and young buyers who justify very risky valuations in meme stocks retail investors are the market makers and they decide what valuations stocks deserve $f is superior in most financial metrics compared to the ev meme stocksimo yet its still at the bottom of the valuation list compared to them if you are new to wsb $tsla and $amd were among our first great plays in here before $gme we used to yolo deep otm calls on

here bought $ calls we were the original adopters of $tsla and we rose it to what it is today still not convinced put a side by side chart comparison between $tsla and $gme and see how the volume and price action was affected during each event its mind boggling if wsb adopts $f it can raise it be the next $ ev play in the industry at that valuation$ it wont even be of teslas week high valuation its a highly speculative valuation but i dont see ford being inferior to the other ev stocks dont even get me started on chinese bs ev stocks with insane valuations and weak deliveries why raise fat foreign chinese babiesnio xpeng etcmetaphorically speaking when americans can literally raise a malnourished all american baby $f 🇺🇸 🦅 ford has always put the american people over money and has provided so many american jobs for the last century ford is a well known american brand and its deeply ingrained in the american history and culture im proud that my grandfather used to work in fordme and had great memories in there in my opinion the strength of this brand will continue on and it will rise from the ashes like an american bald eagle🦅 after a forest fire tldr all american highly

lsn2ty,None,N/A,they are trying to margin call us,Discussion,29,0.62,personaanongrata,315,i think that big hedge firms are cognizant of the fact that many of us use margin to invest which is why theyre liquidating their stocks en mass to push the value of our accounts down as low as possible to make us liquidate so we dont get margin called naive on the their part because this only makes us thirst for more blood we should try to target the stocks that they want maybe dividing them by sector and mass purchasing i do believe that american airlines if youre a big holder of that as it was promoted in this thread will be liquidated tomorrow in a brutal way not only did they need to liquidate to cover their shorts for nok amc and gme but i think gme is a diversion but i think they figured out that theres a lot of new investors who dont have the liquidity to cover their margin in effect destroying any and all competition that they had because they had an advance warning by being the cause of the crash they liquidated their stocks before everyone else had the chance to because they perform this after hours this is also why i think they crashed prices so steeply on monday and only continued the downward decline harsher through the end of the week their intent after and i do think that stocks are going to go down more is to leave a bad taste in the mouth of as many new investors as possible and to shake out anyone who is holding gme or nok or amc by virtue of needing the money i think early to mid next week they will be buying back their shares at the rockbottom price that they push the market to so in the end they are planning to be better off if you have liquidity i suggest you look at the stocks that you could never afford before because i think they think they were stupid in fact i know that they think that were stupid which is a fair point however were so stupid that we dont care about money so long as we have enough to eat unfortunate thing for hedgies is their costofliving is a hell of a lot higher than ours i suggest anybody who does not hold amc nok gme pay close attention and lets figure out which stocks will be targeting next there has to be a pattern to keep track of what theyre doing because they seem to be doing it in collaboration which should be securities fraud but you know how this goes who holds the sec responsible for securities fraud no one gtamerican airlines is going to take a steep dip tomorrow i believe along with every other airline as well again the end goal being here to margin call as many people as possible who dont have liquidity gtgtthe sec can suck my dick ive already lost k to nokia in the last run but frankly i dont give a shit so long as they are hurting if hedge funds are reading what im writing now well speak to texting this isnt going to go well for you we win this time no matter how much you try to put us in the red scare us bully us or manipulate the market with the power that you have we might be stupid apes but apes together strong as for me i doubled down on nokia and amc today i sold off some of my kriptoe this is important pls dont flag at a loss so im heated but i wanted to preserve my real liquidity for when shit gets real next week its not over till the fat lady sayings and i dont see lizzo anywhere any and all input is welcome im gonna go do some pull ups dont spend all your buying power just yet if you havent shits about to get realer imho get shorty i bought a bunch of cheap options today for meme stocks and i will ride them into the fucking dirt before i let them win,2021-02-25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsn2ty/they_are_trying_to_margin_call_us/,1614229200

psychology trading appears deceptively easy when a beginner wins he feels brilliant and invincible then he takes wild risks and loses everything trading is a fascinating intellectual pursuit chess poker and a crossword rolled all into one a trader keeps odd hours and puts his capital at risk many traders are loners who abandon the certainty of the present and take a leap into the unknown the goal of a good trader is not to make money his goal is to trade well if he trades right money follows successful traders keep honing their skill if you become half a percent smarter each year youll be a genius by the time you die focus on trading right and improving your skills so that money no longer influences your emotions the trouble with winning is that many people self destruct soon after accidentprone drivers keep destroying their cars and selfdestructive traders keep destroying their accounts traders who are not at peace with themselves often try to fulfill their contradictory wishes in the market if you do not know where you are going you will wind up somewhere you never want to be a successful trader is a realist he knows his abilities and limitations he sees what is happening in the markets and knows how to react to them analyzes the markets without cutting corners observe your own reactions and make realistic plans once an amateur takes a few hits and gets a few margin calls he becomes fearful instead of cocky losers buy sell or miss trades thanks to their fantastic ideas or fears they act like children who are afraid to look under their bed our fantasies influence our behavior even if we are not consciously aware of them a successful trader must identify his fantasies and get rid of them “i lost because i didnt know trading secrets “those ladder attacks” many losers have a fantasy that successful traders have some secret knowledge this is called the brain myth losers do not know that trading is intellectually fairly simple it is less demanding than taking out an appendix building a bridge or trying a case in court good traders are often shrewd but few of them are intellectual often after the amateur is sold out the market reverses and moves in the direction he expected losers take this reversal as a confirmation of their methods they earn save or borrow enough money to open another small account the story repeats the loser gets wiped out the markets reverse a loser is not undercapitalized his mind is underdeveloped he overtrades and his money management is sloppy he takes risks that are too big whatever the size of his account a trader who wants to survive and prosper must control his losses you do that that by risking only a tiny fraction of your equity on any single trade give yourself several years to learn how to trade do not start with an account bigger than $ and do not lose more than percent of your equity on any single trade learn from cheap mistakes in a small account amateurs neither expect to lose nor are in any way prepared for it the notion of being undercapitalized is a copout that helps them avoid two painful truths their lack of trading discipline and their lack of a realistic money management plan most human activities call for an exercise of judgment machines and systems can help but not replace humans just look at accountants airlines pay high salaries to pilots despite having autopilots they do it because humans can handle unforeseen events traders who have the autopilot fantasy try to repeat what they felt as infants their mothers used to fulfill their needs for food warmth and comfort most

lsy6uc,None,N/A,dd about sha schaeffler a german industrial and car supplier,DD,14,0.66,gabbathrow,35,fellow investors autists and retards this is my very first dd and actually this is not about getting quick tendies and much more about a midterm or even longterm value play so if you do not want that please skip this post and go back to focus on gme otherwise keep on reading please note this is an old throwaway account of mine because i do not want any relation to be made between my person and this dd so this dd is about the german supplier company schaeffler sha be aware of some currency switching between € and $ as well as a wall of text key facts about the company this is their website they employ roughly employees worldwide generated billion € in sales in billion $ net revenue of million € in million $ million € in which decreased because of the carcrisis precorona growth in sales and in revenue outperformed all supplier competitors and automotive manufacturers in the past years as of today they have billion market cap million shares publicly traded for figures see below what is the business model schaeffler is one of the biggest automotive and industrial suppliers worldwide it is a german company with solid financials read more below their focus relies on high quality and precision components and systems in the automotive and industrial sphere now what does this mean is automotive not industrial let me explain that schaeffler has three divisions automotive which is supplying almost all automotive manufacturers in the world even tesla industrial which is supplying stuff for machine tools industry and iot solutions of mechanical form and renewable energy generation they are inside almost every windmill in the world afaik automotive aftermarket which is essentially the division that is supplying all the car workshops with spare parts for cars you can see they are setup in a broad way i have more information on the individual divisions down below now those divisions rely on the same knowledge and manufacturing lines more or less which generates lots of synergies in the company and creates additional value instead of just catering to all industries at all costs about the family shareholders and the stock schaeffler is more or less a family company which is listed at all major stock exchanges a couple of years ago they had their ipo with a listing of € $ i think that was in they then rocketed pretty quickly to € currently only million shares of its shares are free float and publicly traded their traded shares also have no voting rights but have a nice dividend to them of the net revenue the other of shares have a voting right but are all owned by the family schaeffler by a holding company the family schaeffler the holding company also owns of continental another supplier company that is almost triple the size of schaeffler and currently has a market cap of billion € there is quite a lot as to why this is the case but in my opinion that is not really as important for this dd long story short in schaeffler tried to buy and swallow continental then the financial crisis hit and they had to take on lots of debt automotive technologies division with automotive schaeffler is generating the largest part of its turnover and revenue i do not have to add that this is also hurting them right now because it is obvious however when auto is back to business schaeffler always outpaced its competitors and even the oems with its growth and revenue share schaeffler has parts in almost every car in the world in the automotive division schaeffler is manufacturing and developing all sorts of stuff for vehicles this obviously includes combustion technology boring exciting is what new stuff they have on the shelves first of all that is a technology for autonomous cars and they are currently the only company that has the permit to use this technology on the road in a lot of countries already right now google space drive next is technology for electric cars they acquired a smaller company that is known for its extremely efficient electric motors their wiring technology and know how is superior it seems like every other month schaeffler is acquiring new orders for its electric motors whether it be in pure electric cars hybrid cars or heavy duty vehicles they are also on the forefront of developments for the usage of hydrogen in cars and other applications also industrial besides the obvious business with european oems they are in quite large business with us and chinese oems chinese business growing the fastest according to their recent releases industrial division the industrial division is where they are manufacturing stuff for typical industrial applications like bearings for wind mills they are inside almost every wind mill worldwide afaik or machine tool stations here they are also working on developing smart bearings that know when their life span has ended this is crucial in large scale manufacturing lines where a bearing failure can result in multiple million $ of damages schaefflers solution for that is essentially marketed under the brand optime condition monitoring obviously incorporating all sorts of industry applications as well as internet of things by the way schaeffler is also active in aerospace where they are actively helping to reduce the co emssions of planes i could see them maybe work with drones in the future and rumor has it they even work on adapting the emobility motor technology for the aerospace industry they are also inside many space applications such as space rockets and the rovers automotive aftermarket division aftermarket is where schaeffler is selling stuff and spare parts and repair kits to automotive workshops to fix cars essentially honestly i have no idea about the division and they make up for the smallest part fo the turnoverrevenue what is cool here is that afaik they can sell their stuff to all workshops and it can then be put into cars where applicable that were not even equipped with schaeffler parts originally which would mean that is quite a huge market the margins also seem to be quite good current financial numbers and costefficiency measures now that we all have a very rough understanding of what schaeffler is about and what they are doing let us talk a little bit about risks current financial numbers and what schaeffler is doing to increase their flexibility and financial basis initially schaeffler lowered their expected results for in january they then published an adhoc release saying that they unexpectedly outperformed their planning and can close the past year better than expected see here from my point of view they will end up with less turnover compared to which would be billion € billion € and a margin of which is incredibly good for the current times if you are asking me might be that i read the release wrong lol how did they achieve those results let us talk about costefficiency measures they have initiated even before the automotive crisis started long before corona obviously i am not too fond here and we can only learn about this from their own publications they are laying off people closing plants that are no longer as profitable as before they are moving manufacturing to lower cost countries and they are digitalizing and optimizing all their processes according to schaeffler their initiatives are working and their preliminary figures underlign this risks well obviously if the car market or industry market keeps crashing and does not recover then this will plummet again the floor around € held quite good though and we had a run up to € the last days the thing is this company is heavily investing in new technologies now and tries to reinvent itself they recently announced an investment in a new central laboratory for rampd if emobility doesnt get big well then schaeffler is excellent in combustion tech if emobility kicks in which is what we all expect arent we then schaeffler has all the right equipment knowledge and tools at hand they even already get lots of orders for emobility stuff check their press releases from the past months in my opinion this is pretty failsafe another risk is that schaeffler got approval to issue new shares in the coming years if the need arises approval was given in the last shareholders meeting in obviously the only one allowed to vote is the family shareholder so this is an obvious risk in the next years stock price compared to other supplier and automotive stocks so yes as written beforehand the company is getting some flack for the boring combustion engine technology for having lots of employees and so on but how does their performance compare to other companies we can compare that with continental timken a much smaller us supplier and some automotive oems like vw gm and the like comparing their stocks charts reveals something super interesting all of the above pretty much all car manufacturers as well as suppliers started plummeting in because of a lack of car sales and then started a slow recovery until covid hit in march today most automotive oems are almost back to levels talking about suppliers the situation is a little worse but almost all of them are dealing with their stock being traded below precovid levels however schaeffler is at a much higher discount now if you factor in the performance of schaeffler in and the preliminary figures from above paragraph you notice that a more or less fair value of the stock would be something around € while it is sitting at € at this very moment so from my point of view there already is an upside of in the short term once people realize this is trading at a discount not even factoring in what they are doing in terms of future growth with emobility and industry stuff in the mid term what else is going on from here on this is more speculation than dd but nevertheless i wanted to mention it so last but not least there is something interesting going on lately besides the typical insider buying of shares which happens on a regular basis from almost all executives especially the ceo the family shareholder mrschaeffler recently gave all of his shares in schaeffler so of the company as well as all continental shares so of conti in pawn i dont know the exact english wording for that for a bank credit line essentially the shares serve as a security for the credit line now how much is that in terms of money more than billion € almost billion $ at the time this took place at the beginning of february so billion $ in securities plus his other securities privately owned stuff would result in a credit that is atleast billion $ from my point of view now why would you need that if you still have a positive cashflow even during corona and an auto crisis this is indeed a very good question so to answer this question i first had to research why anyone would have to put that many securities in the bank for a credit line and why would anyone use shares as a security the result is in out of cases this is typical behaviour for a loan that will be used to purchase and swallow another company i then researched which other companiescompetitors could be relevant and are in the ballpark of billion $ honestly i couldnt find any but then i remembered that continental will bring its entire drivetrain division conventional combustion engine tech plus all the emobility stuff and electronics and mechatronics to the stock market with a spin off and coincidentally this part of continental is worth something around billion € billion $ according to wikipedia you can google continental vitesco spin off however schaeffler already owns of continental and as such also of the supposed spin off company nevertheless this was the most reasonable thing they could do with such a huge loan in my opinion the schaeffler ceo always refuses this option and typically answers questions in that regard with agility is more important than pure size in his latest interview with a german financial newspaper couple days ago he said this again and also said they are more looking into acquiring something in the industrial sphere and not automotive also they would favor smaller acquisitions rather than bigger ones so take all that with a grain of salt target price nope you are not going to get this from me as i am not educated enough for it on march they are going to release the full year results as discussed in the earlier paragraph the numbers are basically already published and are above expectations depending on the capital increase with new shares andor the purchasing of another company i can not predict any prices for this stock however i am on there with shares at € yes pretty sad i know lol but looking to average down personally i expect a potential increase in the shares price of in the midterm range tldr schaeffler is a solid german supplier with solid financials and a good business model compared to its results it is highly undervalued especially considering its current measures for cost efficiency as well as lots of orders for electric mobility projects from major automotive manufacturers in the billions for the next years fuck me because i jumped in around €share but it is a long term hold for me ampxb no financial advice i like the

and can withstand it disclaimer i am not a financial advisor of any sort this is my opinion and it should not be taken as the word of god full disclosure i am also fucking retarded and it is better if you listen to a monkey and the apes than myself this is also based on my theories and speculation as some of you may know osk oshkosh was awarded the usps contract for the new fleet of vehicles it was a contract for $m to finalize production for nextgeneration vehicles the total contract can be worth up to $b to supply to over years once the news broke out osk went from ≈$ to ≈$ high this is about a increase in the companys value which is ≈ b in market cap value with osks ttm revenue of b it gave them a multiple of revenue of ≈x the ttm ebitda $m which calculates ≈ times multiple these multiples do not account for the projected revenue and ebitda with the new usps contract the industry average on ebitda multiples is around times for manufacturing companies the average multiple for auto amp trucking is times according to nyu stearns without the projections of ebitda gains from the usps contract it is already significantly undervalued based on enterprise value ebitda tldr even if osk was at the alltime high of $ per share it was still undervalued by approximately times using ttm numbers no projections and based on usps gains this is based on the auto and trucking industry standards for public companies in other words it didnt matter if osk got the usps contract or not it was still way undervalued i am screaming at the top of my lungs that osk is undervalued so you are probably wondering why osk fell like a ton of bricks back to $ when the news about one house democrat cried foul play on the usps deal whatever i am going to say now is partially theory pulled based on available information online i would love for anyone to call me out if i may be wrong but post your positions also this is where workhorse plays a significant role in the movement of osk stock as some of you might have noticed wkhss value dropped by nearly after it was announced that osk was awarded the contract rather than wkhs some may agree and some might disagree but wkhs was banking on the contract to essentially survive in other words it was a hail mary that would have saved them from all their struggles i will not go into enterprise value and ebitda ratios with wkhs or any of that because they only have a ttm revenue of ≈k you read right k not m it would just be a waste of my time this is really scary because wkhs has a lot of debt on its books as of wkhs had a net debt of $m additionally wkhs raised an additional m this adds up to around m in debt assuming they did not pay any off from there was no way for wkhs to service that debt without bringing in new revenue if they cannot service the debt based on historical numbers how are they going to service the new debt the creditors approved debt as they were betting on wkhs getting the usps contract wkhs either had some excellent investment bankers or the underwriters need to be fired because this was pure speculation which is a big bet for debt financing when the news came out two days ago that osk was awarded the contract wkhs went tits up even though the terms on the loans did not require wkhs to repay debt until creditors felt the pressure as wkhs lost the contract additionally the companys value decreased by half leading to any debt convertible to stocks being less valuable if creditors do not feel that a company is capable of servicing a debt they can recall the loan anytime correct me if i am wrong this probably was going to happen they were flirting with insolvency and all their investors would have lost their investment the largest investor before all this drama was not ark it was your big institutions and mutual funds ie blackrock inc vanguard group inc the and seaport global asset management llc and they would have lost a lot of money tldr paragraph wkhs was close to being insolvent if creditors decided to pull the plug they had all the reason to with wkhs losing the race for the usps contract disclaimer this is speculation and theories what does this have to do with osk going down they both have the same largest institutional investors backing the stock blackrock and vanguard within a day after the news blackrock would have lost ≈$m in value and vanguard would have lost ≈$m assuming they did not sell any shares after they both would have made only ≈m from the osk stock price jump this leaves them with the choice of the small gain from osk or large losses from wkhs if these institutions let wkhs sink they would have lost all their investment which was approximately an additional $m for blackrock and $m for vanguard these are just calculations for of the institutional investors institutions would have to bear a larger cost letting wkhs go bk without some gains rather than allowing osk to jump up from the news the creditors also would have lost a lot of money if this were to happen as there will be unserviced debt and a loss in value in the convertible stocks even if osk went down the suits would not have lost much money because osk can sustain itself without the usps contract with osks management osk has grown year over year this is not just enterprise value they increased revenue and ebit every year before the covid since the ceo has been in place tldr paragraph big money and creditors would have lost big by letting wkhs go bk it is okay for osk to fall in the short term because it is undervalued and they proved they could grow year over year this is where a lot of manipulation might be happening behind the scenes there was a bunch of shorting and options activity during this time this was probably institutional investors hedging their bets to make up for losses for example ark bought multiple dips on wkhs as the stock plummeted from the news they nearly doubled their position by the timing of god himself news came out merely hours claiming house dem will push back hard on usps decision to choose osk this is apparently one house democrat crying foul play not the whole house where the title tries to mislead you into thinking since osk was linked to the usps contract it fell with regards to the news in my opinion way too much as i believe it is extremely undervalued there might also be additional selling to exacerbate the wkhs dump as i finish writing this wkhs was a clear buy then sell scheme with news that was overexaggerated and probably paid for to minimize huge losses that would have come with wkhs insolvency the people who would bear the pain are people who believed that wkhs is a good company i have seen people comparing wkhs to nikola stating how it was undervalued compared to each other what they dont understand is that they were comparing garbage to garbage with this belief that wood can do no wrong a bunch of people jumped over the cliff tldr paragraph osk had to take the fall for wkhs while the markets were manipulated to prop up wkhs so the suits would not have to take as big of a loss the pain will be transferred to the retail investors as a sea of retailer investors followed cathie wood into buying the dip positions osk $ call ely sbux t gme,2021-02-26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lszghw/osk_vs_wkhs_lets_talk_about_the_madness/,1614315600

lt7miq,DON,7.51%,dont sell at a loss some advice on fundamentals for new traders,DD,5697,0.94,Dumputer,1145,💎🙌🦍here i wrote some basic advice ill repost here for any newbies who want to get in on the action or anyone who bought high and is for whatever dumb reason thinking about paperhanding paperhanding is fundamentally bad investment practice especially if youre a new investor ill explain why dislaimer ive only been trading for a few years and i only know this shit because i have a mentor in finance who taught me this stuff and he hasnt steered me wrong yet so take it for what its worth but based on all the fact that paperhanding is even an issue here you apes clearly need this advice edit these are fundamentals to the way i trade but obviously everyones trading strategy is different note that this is a quantitative approach to investing which doesnt encourage yoloing this is one way to invest which does not require you to outsmart the general public by spotting opportunitiesvalue before the market does i feel its particularly relevant to the gme play the ticker symbol is less important than what you do with it there are other approaches which often require more experience but i feel this is most accessible to new investors gme is the hot stock right now but this applies to everything well everything that you dont think will go bankrupt or get delisted new traders or people who are thinking of becoming new traders should read this especially if youre new i think you should follow these guidelines to avoid losing serious money in the stock market this applies to all stock not just gme if youre experienced it might just sound like im explaining at length why but since a friend of a friend told me he paperhanded on gme sold the dip i feel compelled to explain why what he did was a bad idea i would encourage people to buy gme but only with money you are willing to say goodbye to for a while edit in addition just to reiterate keep plenty of money in reserve so you can buy more if the stock goes down by this i mean never sell at a loss simply hold or buy more to bring your cost average down all newbie investors imo should adhere to this rule just in general buy stock prepared to ride it into the ground or dont buy it at all many investors myself included follow this rule religiously not just with gme but with all stocks i have never lost money in the stock market because i never sold at a loss i just held or bought more covid crashed the market while my portfolio was maxed out i just held and was fine should have bought more if everyone bought into gme with this mindset i bet it would go to pluto easily if you sell at a loss you are donating to the save the short sellers fund out of your own wallet fucking yourself over and betraying your fellow apes and youre not even following sound investment practice just chain yourself to that rocket and enjoy if youre thinking of investing so much that youll wuss out poop your diaper and smash the sell button with shaking paper hands at the slightest hint of red just dont emotion and the stock market do not mix well stop losses below purchase price are also for pansies and genuine idiots “ill sell you some stock but only if you give me a bad enough price on it” your plan should be to buy when the stock goes down if you feel like you need a stop loss youre investing more than you should instead of being stupid maybe try investing less and keep money in reserve so you can buy the dips side note personally in the case of gme i dont have any limit sells either from what i can tell on past short squeezes the price seems to go parabolic for at least half a day before coming back down so as long as you keep an eye on gme when it actually does skyrocket you should have plenty of time set price alerts and relax no need to shoot yourself in the foot by ditching the rocket midlaunch although if you want you can try to profit off gme volatility some people are getting shamed for taking profits but im not sure they deserve it as far as i know buying low and selling high doesnt really help hfs it drives the price up just not as much as buying and holding but personally my philosophy is i can take baby profits anytime who knows when something like this gme rise will happen again so im holding shares at cost average $share want to get into the game now you could always just buy a few shares and keep the rest of what youre willing to invest in reserve in case of a dip and buy a little bit more each time it goes down more bringing your cost average down ideally you should always have a loose plan for how much you will buy at each phase if the stock goes down to near zero always try to keep cash in reserve locked yourself in at a high price thats why you keep cash in reserve so you can buy the dip and average down didnt keep any cash in reserve guess youre stuck waiting for one of three things the short squeeze which will likely though not certainly happen for the price of gme to rise naturally over years as the value of the company increases or you get your hands on some more cash youre willing to say goodbye to bring your cost average down do not sell at a loss and you will never lose edit well seldom if ever unless the company goes bankrupt a rare occurrence this is why you dont put all your eggs in one basket and plan so even if you buy all the way down to zero it wont swallow your portfolio also if you truly fucked up and used money that you need for health insurance or something you may just have to back at least partially out with your tail between your legs and consider it a lesson hedge funds and billionaires know this thats why their wealth increased so dramatically during the pandemic they bought the dip while regular folks paperhanded and got even poorer one more little trick if you manage to scoop up a nice juicy shares then even if your position goes “underwater” you can always sell calls at above your average cost bring down your cost basis and make money off your stock “risk free” while still following the rule of never sell at a loss although if you did it right this second the risk would be missing out on a once in a lifetime historic short squeeze bear in mind though it may take months for the squeeze to actually happen and youll need to be patient and like i said before say goodbye to your money for a while edit just to reiterate there are many trading strategies and i just feel this is one of the best for newbies trade however you want just dont paper hand gme i would also note that you can sell some shares below your cost basis and still follow this rule if your sell is paired with a buy order that you executed at a lower price it still follows the rule of dont sell at a loss buy one share at $ and sell it at $ doesnt matter if you still have shares in the red from earlier you can even slowly take your cost basis down by doing the thing where you buy a share when it goes down and sell one when it goes up edit yes i know about opportunity cost it does apply if you know something the general public doesnt rare if youre just a low iq ape but gme wasis an exception many traders make money hopscotching between stocks regardless of loss but unless you know something the market doesnt it could be a coin flip whether youll hit rock bottom in an ideal world you can keep some money in reserve so you dont have to realize losses to jump on new opportunities yes i know about and agree with the sunk cost fallacy my point is about gradually buying as the stock depreciates and becomes a better deal lowering the cost basis not “doubling down” on sunk cost tldr 🦍buy 🍌 dont give 🐍 🍌 unless 🐍 give more than 🦍pay for 🍌 not financial advice i am literally a zoo ape that somebody dropped their phone into the

lst66i,None,N/A,“the real moon play” multifaceted infinite squeeze cycle,Discussion,841,0.97,Low-Classroom7736,361,revised i think i get it now its not one or the other squeeze its all of them together driving each other congress just had them testify about round but they dont even know round two is gonna bigger they turned the issue into even more discussed worldwide news that may not be the “catalyst” but it is aerosolized fuel in an enclosed space ready for a spark the armageddon only statistically possible but completely unimaginable scenario were heading towards we all know the shorts exceed the number of available shares and the original short squeeze thesis but now we have the gamma squeeze taking part retail figured out how to counter synthetic shorts by forcing institutions to honor call options every call option that has been written and is in the money must purchase shares in the open market even though there are not enough shares in existence to do that and not just the shares in the market this would mean the entire share count held by hedges and clearing houses being transferred to retail and etf ownership through options being exercised retail countered the naked shorting in way that not only negates it but exponentially increases the squeeze process itll be like using a market order to cover a short squeeze gobbling up any share no matter the costremember the k snipe orders last time except at a market wide level the entire float plus forced shares bought for itm contracts how much can something cost when it doesnt exist but has to be bought the ultimate lesson in supply and demand itll be like taking the strength of pliers and adding a hydraulic press we were all looking at it like round one over extended hedgie shorts vs retail holders forcing a cover but the dynamic has evolved to a multi faceted infinite squeeze cycle this is “the moon” play this makes that ai suggestion of k a share make sense im not saying the ai is right necessarily in terms of price i am saying its gonna take a deeper look at what happens when institutions owe more than they cant deliver and resulting price movement further exacerbates the original step the machine takes information and extrapolates it went to k when it was retail using available shares to force shorts to cover how multiplied can it get when that happens again while institutions are forced to buy share lots for contracts there wont be enough open shares on the market theyll have to sell their own to the option holders just to honor them theyll have to buy more from other brokers and clearing houses having the same problem and all of this is compounded even further because the higher this drives the stock the more option contracts are itm more forced buying and giving their own shares more squeezes more contracts itm repeat repeat repeat repeat thats the important part not just the squeezes the “cycle” because its self perpetuating past a certain point like a dying star reaching the critical mass it takes to become a black hole i saw someone even mention that once and i didnt understand but they were right it would literally crash the stock market and effect all foreign markets involved an upwards crash that sucks all capital from the largest players i see people mentioning “rational thought” or “rational behavior” of the stock but its not rational holding something beyond its suggest value breaks with the notion of rational value systems its mass irrational behavior to cause extreme hyperbolic stock movement i feel like hyperbolic is the right word over parabolic you know how when you buy a call it technically has the potential for unlimited gain because the stock can theoretically go up infinitely this is exactly that situation being played out on a grand scale i think its kind of amazing because this is the defining characteristic of using the the stock market instead of gold it increases the amount of perceived wealth beyond the physical capabilities of the world theres not enough gold or precious metals to equal the world economy its made up to represent something that cant exist but is necessary to facilitate the notion of unlimited growth and now that very same principle may be inadvertently used to either destroy the system or force an evolution of financial theory the entire point of this idea is that the mechanics are being broken by players refusing to acknowledge parameters they learned to cheat the system back at us the first time shorts are creating shorts of shorts they dont exist theyre making unlimited shares to maintain their position so buyers are gonna do the same thing but purposely do it in an arena that cant be expanded indefinitely they can make up the shorts they borrow back and forth with each otherand through unknowing retail stocklending program participants but there are only so many real shares they are inarguably finite by definition could they force a reverse split or force dilution by issuing new shares against shareholders and the companys will i dont know all we have to do is hold hold on to your sense of wonder as the story plays out hold to your courage im not a financial advisor and dont know what im talking about i just like this stock and stories about the end of the world i dont even care about the money that much i just want to take control of my own life i cant wait for us to read about this moment in history someday and each think about what small parts we played and how we remember it apes together

ltmxom,None,N/A,is shorting bonds the new infinite money glitch,DD,105,0.81,DivySuresh,92,good morning my fellow degenerates hope you all are in good health and spirit tldr shorting bonds could be one hell of a play shorting emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds might be the fucking moonshot if im right today i want to talk about the most boomer investment there is fixed income securities or bonds so just some background information bonds are a debt based security meaning that you are loaning a company municipality or government money in exchange for regular interest payments but the underlying issue i see is when any significant inflation happensits when not if more on this later and the fed hikes rates most of the bonds issued now and in the past few years suffer from something called interest rate risk interest rates share an inverse relationship with bonds so when rates rise gt existing bonds fall this makes sense because why would you ever keep money in a bond paying x when the current going rate for bonds is much higher this kind of market pressure can quickly tank bond prices which is why i think shorting certain corporate bonds or etfs who hold corporate bonds is a good idea why inflation is going to spike this topic has been discussed to death here on wsb by the few 🌈🐻who havent yet been hunted to extinction by jpows money printer now im not going to waste your time and explain in detail every reason i believe relatively high inflation is just on the horizon that being said im going to recap the highlights of the core arguments mmoney supply has increased drastically through quantitative easing but unlike where they lowered rates through decreasing yields on treasuries theyve also started buying up other debt securities directly decreasing yields across the board they did this to help ease the burden on businesses and allow them to borrow money for much cheaper they also did this because the credit market froze and when the debt market freezes you know shit is about to go down but this time also unlike the fed went full brrrrrr and well ampxb does injecting this much money into the system seem sustainable to you ampxb the graph really speaks for itself so much money has been injected into the economy through the debt markets that bonds yields are practically nothing the reason we havent seen that money actually inflate the economy is because the velocity of money has tanked for the retards in the back who fell asleep in econ the velocity of money is the rate at which money changes hands to purchase a good or service within a given timeframe because economies all across the world are dampened at the moment with all the restrictions and shutdowns the average consumer is spending much less now than they would otherwise be expected to the velocity of money is going to skyrocket as the economies of the world open back up as all this money which was previously locked up in households and businesses reenters the economy well likely see a sharp uptick in inflation now the people who run the federal reserve arent dumb they realize that this sharp rise in inflation is bad the fed doesnt want to see runaway inflation and so theyll do whatever they can to counteract the effects of printing this much money the most effective way of the fed counteracting all this printing is by creating a big negative liquidity shock this is known as quantitative tightening read raising interest rates which is going to absolutely decimate bond prices which is why credit where credit is due as a liquidity shock occurs the market usually does sell off so the 🌈🐻 converting to a cash position isnt actually the worst thing you could do but then again being cash gang means inflation gang is slowly eating your effective capital it also means you hold a position even more fucking boomer read boring as shit than investing in bonds congrats now that we established what interest rate risk is how it effects bonds and why were likely to see a substantial amount of it in the coming months years its time to narrow down the pool of bonds we could short governments across the world are printing money like theres no tomorrow and this is because the growth corrected interest rate is negative its not only negative in europe and japan but also much of the developing world which means governments there are much likelier to take on higher amounts of debt now mathematically speaking this is fine as long as compound growth outpaces or stays in line with compound interest this debt is manageable it becomes less and less of a burden with each subsequent year inflation the problem occurs when that growth is strained or when interest rates get hiked most rates are effectively negative accounting for growth i think the prime target is emerging market foreign junk grade corporate bonds that are denominated in usd the reason i say this is in the event of qt by the fed there will be a liquidity shock creating a spike in demand for us dollars which is what the world relies on for most global trade this makes the dollar gain value in relation to other currencies quite quickly and probably unexpectedly unless the market prices this in which will see these bonds decrease in value anyway making your short position profitable bonds from companies that primarily do business in local currencies but hold debt denominated in dollars face exchange rate risk if the price of their local currency falls in relation to the us dollar they end up paying much more than expected in their local currency to keep up with their payments if this is not an investment grade bond it means rating agencies think the company has heightened default risk so this very well could be the straw that breaks the camels back and bankrupts some of these companies even if they stay solvent i think the increased risk would cause a decent sell off now because im not blind and i see the sentiment on this sub and their views on short selling unlike melvin and co i am not over shorting or illegally naked short selling a company and directly engineering the failure of these assets companies i am merely using the data available to me and making a bet on where bond prices will be in a few years time if i enter this trade and or make money off it i will donate a portion of the winnings to a charity that operates within the emerging markets i shorted why the fuck are you telling me this now if this isnt going to happen for a while because the sooner individual investors recognize the opportunity the sooner individual investors can pick the best targets furthermore all of this is for naught if rate hikes are priced in before individual investors enter their short position this is already priced in no the fuck it isnt why do you think theres usually a market selloff and downward pressure on debt markets directly following rate hike announcements unless the news is ridiculously old most of the time it isnt priced in i watched you retards claim disney was priced in for weeks and i still saw disneys stock spike on rollout day disclaimers disclaimer i am not as familiar with debt markets as i am with derivative and equity markets so i may have missed something obvious theres a reason i post this shit before i actually call my broker to initiate the short position i am also not a certified financial advisor investment in any security poses risk not all positions are suitable for all investors keep your goals needs and risk appetite in mind before you invest disclaimer shorting debt instruments like bonds carries hidden interest payment risk youre liable for paying the interest payments until you close out of your short position bonds are also much less liquid than stocks so finding bonds to close out your position could be difficult shorting is also an unlimited risk strategy so idk maybe buy calls on the bonds to hedge let me know what you think am i the next dr michael mcflurry burry or the most retarded thing this sub has seen since robinhood box spreads i dont want to go full retard so i figured id let you glorious autists critique my position tell me

ltpnrj,HF,N/A,why melvin and the other hfs basically have no chance of winningimo,Discussion,2062,0.93,Upper_Piano1809,471,there is only one answer as to how on earth shorting was allowed this is due to the concept of naked shorting this in simple terms is when shorters like big institutions like melvin decide to short the stocks without locating the stock holders basically meaning they are shorting without caring about if their shorts match the supply of holders and this lead to shorting which lead to phantom shares this is all highly illegal except for one exception to the best of my belief youtube it and read up on the sec to confirm otherwise dont believe me an exception to which the government will turn the check is when naked short selling a company that results in bankrupt by which they end up making big amounts of profit why does this even matter its because through these phantom shares they are able to manipulate the ‘failure to deliver system in the stock market and so through manipulating these failure to delivers they trick the algorithm into having to adjust a sell off they do this to trick us and to make us actually fear and cause a real sell off they belief this hype is temporary that will pass they do not realise that we are not cats that are not playing around no more think about it no honestly think about iteveryone was gunning for $ the way in which we are all diamond handing this hold then why would a natural sell off occur only half way its because of market manipulation caused by the restrictions of being able to buy shares the news media penetrating that the interest in gme was over and these failure to deliver and ladder attacks the majority of us are still holding holding through and didnt sell when it went down why well its simple its because the squeeze has not been squoze now back to naked short selling this is market manipulation at its finest but of course gamestop is no longer dead through the great help of ryhan cohens and wsb the giant has been revived once more meaning that there is inevitable death for the hfs as long as we manage to hold shorting requires for interests to have to be paid in order to keep the position open which means that if we hold on long enough we will absorb melvin dry the more hype there is the more these interests go up and thats our key to pulling off a wicked gamma squeeze like nothing seen before usits a great time to be alive and although it may appear on screen that short interest is back under the mark i think that the final of shorts wont be able to be deductible since its made up of phantom shares melvins and all the other hedgefunds only way to succeed was for them to pull this short off in the shadows without anyone realising this stock has been shorted for years but that plan has now epically failed so now they know they have no choice but to use any dirty tactics they can to divide and conquer through any and every manipulation tactics that exist its corruption vs the people unity will prevail if we stay strong together 💎 hold my diamond apes our promised day is near 💎🚀📈📈📈📈📈📈📈 disclaimer this is not financial advice this is merely the thoughts of a smooth brained ape so i honestly dont want you to believe anything i said i dont know what im talking about and im smoking on crayons as we speak the purpose was to point you to the right directions and now i want you to do your own research about naked short selling implications and verify if i am correct to the best of my ability i do believe what i said is right but like i said im a smooth brained ape so i could be wrong theres really only one way to know and thats for you to do your own research take my thoughts with a pinch of salt,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ltpnrj/why_melvin_and_the_other_hfs_basically_have_no/,1614402000
lts4ip,None,N/A,due diligence post petrobras pbr,DD,14,0.65,CaiusGnome,36,this post is the sharing of my due diligence for petrobras ticker pbr aka pabst blue ribbon after their most recent q results from thursday february here are the important facts in my opinion cash flow from operations during the three months ended was $ billion usd this represents of their market capitalization during one quarter in q i expect it will be at least $ billion if not more that means if they took the cash on hand at of $ billion plus their cash flows from operations during just the fiscal year they could buy back more than of their current market cap of common stock their stock tends to move in conjunction with oil prices and also the brl local currency compared to the us dollar so when the us dollar is weaker the stock goes up over the past months the us dollar has increased against the brl by about pushing the pbr stock price down during that time i believe with the us stimulus about to pass that this trend will reverse back significantly the recent news on monday regarding the replacement of the current ceo of pbr with a retired general was due to complaints about diesel fuel the stock dropped approximately due to this news when you review the financials you can see in q that $ billion of the $ billion of revenues relates to diesel fuel this is about of the revenues of the company however the discounts that the government is asking pbr to make will not eliminate the revenue it will potentially cause maybe a reduction so this in effect is only a reduction of revenue by also the board of directors has refused to allow this discount so far therefore i believe the stock price decline is much steeper than the effect to the company revenues of the tech industry is declining as interest rates rise investors are in the process of moving into reopening stocks and commodity stocks in therefore this is a tailwind for pbr especially considering that biden wants to shut down oil production in the usa which will further increase the price of oil and will not affect pbr in any way as brazil doesnt restrict the oil exploration function in brazil in the same way that biden wants to in the usa so there will be no impairments on pbrs balance sheet like there will be on the usa companies should biden decide to ban certain oil properties from permitting technically the stock found support on monday february at $ per share and bounced higher on friday february the stock did not cross below $ even when the market was moving lower therefore there is strong support at this level my recommendation is first to review the news and financials on the sec website regarding pbr then i recommend purchasing shares of the company under ticker pbr if you want to increase exposure i also recommend purchasing longdated call options at the $ $ and $ levels for either january or january,2021-02-27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lts4ip/due_diligence_post_petrobras_pbr/,1614402000

but our family still has hope jd i use barchart and tos for general flow but use unusual whales scanner for most of my uoa picks shoutout to them for giving permission to use screenshots and such that im playing update docu ceo speaking at morgan stanly tmt conference monday am this c came through last week suicidal strike but i like the sentiment when the shit hits the fan and the indexes are falling im in the lab trying to spot the bullish diamonds in the rough why because the moment i buy a put we are going to new alltime highs i just know it so ive had to work a little harder to pull out the calls and im happy for those of you that got the spot snap and ba tendies from last weeks dd xpev was kind of weird tooi guess i need to take buy american honestly ill take for picks on a bloody week any day though please remember when things are this volatile choose your entries after market action seems to pick a direction after the first hour of the day minimum unless were playing a specific event the difference between a failing play and a intraday play can literally be the difference between buying at open or buying two hours later and dont get greedythis is guerilla warfare right now take your pop profits unless you have pdt restriction in which case go tighter to the strike and much longer than the whale if you cant afford it dont play it there are opportunities every day anyway i want to go in a little different direction this week as something interesting stood out to me ready lets roll the spot whale anatomy of a carcass on monday as i dined on spot tendies while the world burned around me i was struck with a sense of unease amidst the clinking of champagne glasses on sunday afternoon after the dd was written some further research revealed that at am on monday spot was hosting an “investor day” investor day was indeed the whales bet and boy did it pay off with that intraday pop i hadnt heard the term investor day or analyst day thrown around in tech for a bit so my spidey sense was tingling then the next interesting hits came last weeks whales to watch had snap picked as another play to follow based on otm call activity and repeat betting on tuesday and wednesday amidst the storm snap indeed went nuts with intraday pops twtr which id made a note of the week prior had the same activity what was the seemingly invisible string tying these three tech plays together investoranalyst days it was time to get to work the investigation i wanted to see if these investor and analyst days were a recycled and growing phenonemon or something we just havent paid much attention to the results were interesting in two ways snap spot and twtr investor relations pages show these events in but not in or earnings sure annual meetings indubitably conferences yes investoranalyst days nay small sample size obviously but coming from these three within the same quarter after not having hosted any of these events over the past two yearsid call it significant snap spot and twtr investoranalyst days all came shortly after their earnings reports this is important later snap er was investor day was spot er was investor day was twtr er analyst day was all three of these tickers had otm whale bets with expirations the week of the investoranalyst events all three of these came within a month of their er all three of these pumped due to events specifically designed to do just thatpump note i did some quick searching of recent pumped tech and pypl employed the same strategy no investor day in yet after their er on they hosted an investor day on these companies may as well have held up neon fucking signs that said we are having a virtual event where we are going to paump our brains out defining rambo as i continued to poke around i saw more and more similar examples simple searches of otm whale activity for specific dates on the tickers which is then checked against the upcoming investor relations conferences and meetings on their corporate sites gives valuable input for what may be brewing i also saw that morgan stanley is hosting its annual technology media and telecom conference among others our favorite fsly is set to present 😬 😉 given that these plays coincide with investor relations meetingsconferences and are blatant pumps ill refer to it as rambo relations and meeting buy opportunities theorizing recent increases of rambo what stuck out to me was that these recent tech rambos were scheduled to come shortly after their earnings reports spot if youre going to change the world with podcasts in sierra leone or whatever why not announce it during the er you had a couple weeks priorbefore the same can be asked of others like pypl snap twtr etc my theory is that the current er environment—where your stock plummets unless your forward guidance calls for a estimate beat means that companies are working around these unrealistic expectations by saving their best news for afterwards in a way they are hedging against their own reporting with news coming out during a less volatile time after seeing the success of this manuever this past week i wouldnt be surprised if we witnessed a new normal where earnings reports are almost always scheduled with a traling investor day analyst day or key meetingconference so what am i saying im saying that given the volatile environment around earnings reports and troubling market conditions we are likely to see an uptrend in otm whale calls coinciding with rambo separate from earnings reports one of the first things i will be doing when i see a call flow or whale activity that i like is check it against the companies investor relations page and seeing what events they may be taking advantage of hunting for rambo picks ill test this on in light of jnj vaccine this weekend wait on price action to settle for tech calls epd 🚀 🚀 dipping a toe in with this nice boring boomer midstream oil giant they pay a fat ass dividend yield of but lets be reali couldnt care less about that because this dd is about the hunt for glory not my retirement income the real opportunity is in the fact that on friday two separate bets were placed for epd in the near future including a c for they coincided with upcoming rambo as epd is holding an investor day on march th with an esg discussion preceding it on march rd they are also holding a q and a session to field questions from both events you know who else scheduled a q and a to discuss their investor day spot did last week i see this as a confidence move and i see the whale probably thinking their little investor daycould potentially be newsworthy ill roll the dice here but keep it safe and drop if the news is a dud as a side note though oil is just a good long term play for my xom and rds leaps have been puhrinting as always pick a good entry point bidu 🚀 🚀 edit the bidu stock split isnt the traditional one folks go crazy for but is instead a prehk listing split with a neutral effect affect whatever on nasdaq share prices whales and call flow likely related to the hk listing more so than split benefits outright yeah yeah i know i will be shilling bidu to the grave but i saw some more interesting call activity on them it never stops and a nice little c that piqued my interest i hopped over to the investor relations page looking for summadat rambo and found this gtbeijing jan prnewswire baidu inc nasdaq bidu baidu or the company a leading internet platform and ai company today announced that it will hold an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders the egm at am on march beijing time at the address of no shangdi th street haidian district beijing the peoples republic of china a proposal of changing the companys authorized share capital by onetoeighty subdivision of shares share subdivision will be submitted to baidus shareholders to be considered and voted upon at the egm yes thats right bidu is voting on a stock split monday this is also coming ahead of their hk listing to happen soon do i need to remind you what happens in the lead up to a companys split date remember tsla remember aapl well this aint ether of those lol but i like the news and dammit i like the stock can i tell you exactly what they do no can i tell you how much of my life savings is going in alot crm 🚀 😬 crm has been beaten to within an inch of its life recently and you know i love a good falling knife outside of that nearing bottom though theyve got an interesting slate of speaking arrangements lined up with this c theyre trotting out every executive they have for shilling this coming week alone ill play it a little safer a little longer but im in for fishing the bottom here znga 🚀 😬 whale came through with a conservative bet but ill be curious to see what they have to say at upcoming conferences after their ceo essentially begged for somebody to buy them out after er lol not really but yeah kinda theyre speaking at the morgan stanley tech conference on march th am pst nvda 🚀 🚀 im as sick of hearing about the damn chip shortage as you are but nvda has their annual investor day coming up on and calls are starting to trickle in going to feel out this tech dip then probably go with some call spreads near the range for mayoutright call premiums are just insane for this ticker i dont care how rich you are ticker i just like this week jnj because im a bandwagon hopper 🤷🏿‍♂️ and pdd er lotto gamble tldr check the investor relations page if you use call flow or unusual options activity scanners as a lot of newsworthy positive developments seem to be shared via satellite events recently not during er investor day is the new earnings report i like tickers epd bidu crm znga jnj nvda all long on dips and buying in tandem with the above mentioned

lwlol7,None,N/A,high times ipo a dying brand —gt from selling mags to selling bags,DD,19,0.75,seebz69,26,high times is a beloved american monthly magazine and cannabis brand with offices in los angeles and new york city the magazine was founded in by tom forçade and the publication advocates the legalization of cannabis the magazine has been involved in the marijuanausing counterculture since its inception on jan th ditched dreams of nasdaq listing gthightimes holding corp parent of high times revealed that it has abandoned its efforts to list on the nasdaq a goal it had been pursuing for since mid the company launched an offering two years ago at $ per share through the reg a process and it reported that it would extend its reg a capital raise until million shares had been sold or until march st it disclosed in an sec filing that it recently sold shares at $ in a private placement to ontariobased rayray investments raymond leach an original investor in medreleaf a discount to where it has been selling shares high times securities lawyers stephen weiss and megan penick of la based michelman robinson llp confirmed in an email interview that the company can not accept sales until they get their annual report filed and publicly available for investors high times ipo sorry no refunds teri buhl of cannabis law reports talks reg a harvest acquisitions it was in march that harvest health announced an $ million buyout of that entire company then literally two months later we see a letter of intent filed by hightimes now and harvest saying gtokay well were actually going to buy the california assets of have a heart why that was contradictory is that harvest had just been on an investor call telling people when an analyst asked gtwhy are you doing this deal they said well we want a stronger footprint in california it didnt make sense that two months later theyre getting rid of everything they just bought in california additionally in the last month there have beenmultiple news reports questioning if harvest even has ownership or control of the cannabis licenses to sell to high times very little cash actually changes hands in the deals crafted by high times instead it has announced millions of stock which isnt publicly traded yet will pay for the asset purchases with the harvest acquisition high times attorney stephen weiss confirmed for clr that $ million was paid to harvest but at signing only $k was given the asset purchase agreement filed with the sec said high times would pay harvest $ million on signing this is just a complete lack of transparency and its completely unfair for the main street investor trying to get into cannabis done before starting the securities and exchange commission has told a us operated cannabis media and dispensary company high times holdings that they must halt accepting investments in their miniipo because they have failed to meet an extended deadline to file their audited annual report gtthe last date the company was allowed to take investments was the middle of june high times used a reporting extension the sec created because of the covid pandemic to get a day extension to file the annual report and said in recent sec disclosure filings called form u that they promised investors to get them current revenue cash flows debt levels and asset values by june via the annual report but clr has learnt that this never happened adam levins company has spent over two years trying to get main street to invest up to $us million without a successful close date that could lead to publicly traded stock on the otc markets under the ticker $hitm on june th the company made an sec filing announcing once again their miniipo would be extended for yet another three months but left out the important fact that they couldnt actually accept sales when asked if it is normal practice for a reg a issuer to continue to solicit investments when it cant accept sales securities attorney sara hanks said ”the sec may have softened up in the covid crisis but previously both sales and offers were supposed to stop during such time as the issuer was delinquent in its filings because there is no exemption under reg a for “offers” advertising etc while a company is delinquent” high times still has their investment offering page live since then investors have seen a rapid pace of public announcements about asset purchases via signed letter of intents hyping the potential growth of high times followed up with quiet sec filings announcing the deals had either fallen apart or been watered down i have personally fallen for this sham f as i invested in units in they stopped responding to my inquires in fact there was a random charge on my credit card from an airport in la the same day they charged my card for the ipo they stated that it would be refunded never was i can still log on and see the shares i have “invested” but they obviosuly dont represent anything lesson learned recent financials the company filed apostqualification amendment to its form a with the sec that suggests the financial condition has become even more precarious in the first quarter of sales plunged to just $ million most of the decline can be attributed to the events business which fell almost but publishing revenue declined over as well the company indicated that its cannabis cup events will take place later in the year compared to the prior year with one in las vegas and in los angeles taking place in the first quarter of and none in the first quarter of the $k in sales were generated by smaller events and the company expects the number of cannabis cups and small events to increase for the full year it blamed the publishing decline on lower sales at the newsstands and through subscription and lower print advertising revenue with digital partially offsetting these factors the company provided information about its cost of revenue which was $k as well as its operating expenses which declined substantially to $ million producing an operating loss of $ million compared to an operating loss in the first quarter of of $ million much of the yearago operating expenses were due to a onetime noncash charge of $ million for equity compensation charges for consulting the last time the company filed official annual earnings was june high times had told investors it would get updated financial information on june but that did not happen the company has extended the offering of shares for two years initially telling investors that it would list its shares on the nasdaq then it lowered those expectations to the overthecounter marketplace still it hasnt happened i am not a financial advisor so please do your own

lwvezn,EV,N/A,i think igo limited asxigo has an undervalued position as a lithium mining play for the inevitable ev revolution high level dd,DD,24,0.72,VeniceKing719,42,felt compelled to start a discussion given i cant find any mainstream analysis regarding what i think has to be one of the stronger lithium plays to make everyone knows the big dogs in the lithium space albemarle alb sqm ganfeng etc and even the smaller speculative players however it seems there is one mining company thats flown under the radar and quietly secured itself a piece of what i think will be one of the most important lithium mines in the world let me tell you about igo limited asxigo and the deal they made to cut into greenbushes greenbushes mine located in western australia is operated by talison lithium a joint venture by tianqi controlling share and albemarle tianqi bought some shares in sqm at the height of the last lithium boom but since then prices have fallen flat and tianqi is fucked with debt they needed a lifeline and in december igo was happy to help and secure a piece of the lithium powered future for about billion they secured part of a very valuable asset let me explain below greenbushes mine utilizes the hard rock method of lithium mining and depending on who you ask is the largest such mine on earth raw spodumene is mined that is then processed to lithium carbonate from there it can be refined into lithium hydroxide the most sought after lithiumbased component for ev batteries that is one method of mining lithium the other way is via brining brining is the way they do it in the lithium triangle of south america which is where most of the mainstream attention on lithium mining is placed however i think that when the supply crunch comes brine mining will be be disfavored by ev and battery manufacturers let me explain below hard rock vs brine hard rock has a lower production cost but a lower output yield it is relatively immune from the effects of inclement weather it does not require massive amounts of water and its environmental costs are relatively pedestrian compared to brining brine mining has a higher production cost but a higher output however it is affected by inclement weather likely to become a problem over the next years imo requires massive amounts of water and has some pretty steep environmental and political risks source given the large amount of water required in the brining process and the political effect it has on local and indigenous peoples i dont think it is viable in the green future ev and battery makers will feel pressure and may even face regulation that their supply chain is carbon neutral green etc when you consider why the ev revolution is happening it doesnt make sense to buy lithium from a source that requires massive amounts of fresh water a resource that is sure to come under more scrutiny in the next years there is a possibility that innovation could fix the environmental concerns with brining but personally i dont know if that is likely to happen before the supply crunch that is expected by now the key $$$ fact is that when a hard rock mines lithium carbonate is processed into lithium hydroxide it is the highest margin product in the lithium trade cant post the graphic but its in this source along with other great info source brining can also yield lithium hydroxide but it requires an extra step and extra cost in the process to do so so now we know that a hard rock mine that produces lithium hydroxide provides the highest margin product available greenbushes mine has the benefit of a lithium hydroxide refinery vertically integrated into its production cycle the plant is called kwianna and was solely owned by tianqi until igo came in for billion igo secured stake in greenbushes mine and of kwianna lithium hydroxide plant whats interesting is that ablemarle tried to buyout tianqi of its greenbushes share in the summer of from my pov this is indicative of how valuable greenbushes is thankfully the igotianqi deal was structured in a way that per abl spokesman didnt trigger the right of first refusal clause speculation is that china was loathe to let an asset fall in complete control of a rival giant which makes me think that if tianqis financial troubles continue igo could be in a prime spot to secure an additional stake in greenbushes and kwianna tldr brine mining has credible downsides that i believe are being overlooked which could make hard rock miners more desirable by evbattery manufacturers as more attention is placed on their supply chains and the supply crunch comes to fruition greenbushes is the largest hard rock mine in the world and i believe one of the few that has a lithium hydroxide plant vertically integrated igo is in a unique position having bought into a mine with operations already up and running of the mine and of the refinery it is almost completely absent from all lithium mining discussion by mainstream outlets and i dont understand why that is relatively new to investing and posting so if there is a reason that igo isnt a worthwhile play please enlighten me position holding long shares $ usd and buying more when i can cant post the otc ticker as i dont want this post to get removed pm me if you want it not financial advice i like the

lwybmb,ASO,25.57%,$aso dd criminally undervalued,DD,432,0.83,XionTG,420,academy sports amp outdoors aso is criminally undervalued and flying under the radar right now it beat last quarters earnings by x predictions and upcoming earnings will be the catalyst needed to make aso skyrocket guns are a major part of their sales and january had the rd highest singlemonth gun sales recorded in us history fundamental analysis gun sales academy sports and outdoors is focused on selling hunting fishing and camping equipment a major point of interest in this company is its gun sales so long as aso continues to go down the path of marketing and selling guns they will continue to grow especially in todays climate gun sales are up in january from previous months with the thirdhighest monthly total of gun sales on record gun sales surged percent in january data shows the washington post on top of that the number of nics firearm background checks is up from last years monthly average from background checks per month in to in january nics firearm checks monthyear — fbi ceo ken hicks claims that many people picked up new hobbies such as hunting fishing and camping which has helped drive sales and if only of those people continue with those hobbies it will greatly help their sales academy sports ceo says hobbies acquired during covid will continue to drive sales in marketwatch especially if many are scared of future potential gun restrictions created by the democratcontrolled congress now could be a time where we see a surge of gun purchases before any restrictions are made which would drive aso sales locationwise aso is in the perfect position to continue making sales yearround located in the south people can continue their outdoor activities throughout the winter providing aso with sales when it may not otherwise have been able to if it were located further north ampxb ipo and leadership in kkr bought out aso however aso recently went public on october led by ceo ken hicks aso is wellpositioned to continue boosting its sales as ceo at foot locker hicks helped reverse three years of negative samestore sales and he brings his experience in other executive positions to the table academy sports outdoors announces ken c hicks as chairman and ceo aso aso is clearly focused on growth rather than maintenance effective jan aso eliminated the coo position at aso “in order to create a more efficient operating structure and focus on key strategic priorities” academy sports eliminates coo role marketwatch it is focused on increasing its efficiency and sales this is also indicated by the fact that it just went public meaning it intends to use the money gained from its public offering to help grow the company ampxb stimulus bill the $ trillion stimulus bill that was passed by the house on feb would be a huge boost to the company if it were to pass the senate this is not exclusive to aso but it would help the overall economy and give more disposable income for people to spend and help boost sales ampxb financials obtained from yahoo finance click title for link to spreadsheet this is a key part of my valuation of aso it displays how criminally undervalued aso is a company relative to the market as a whole as well as its competitors i have linked a google spreadsheet to this post that shows several key indicators as to why aso is undervalued relative to its competitors i will compare asos financials to dicks sporting goods as they are the most similar competitor asos trailing pe ratio is currently as compared to dks asos forward pe is as compared to dks asos ps ttm is as compared to dks asos pb mrq is as compared to dks additionally its most recent actual earnings eps were x its predicted earnings eps and its predicted earnings for next quarter are eps still well below last quarters earnings aso academy sports and outdoors inc yahoo finance ampxb debt asos debt is one of their few worrisome financial indicators they have a great deal of debt with their debt to equity ratio sitting at as compared to dks however aso has already designated around $ million obtained from their ipo to help pay off some debt is this retail ipo a winner the motley fool they also have the ability to pay off shortterm debt so i do not see this as a company that will likely go bankrupt their current ratio mrq is and although this is significantly lower than many other gunrelated companies it is actually lower than dks which shows that they do in fact have the ability to show off their shortterm debt ampxb short interest while i am not a fan of solely using short interest as an indicator to invest in a stock it can still be a helpful tool according to s research asos short interest as a percentage of its float is as compared to dks both of these are fairly high and show that there is great short interest against both these companies although i strongly believe that there will not be a sudden short squeeze over time i believe that sustained stock price growth will force investors to cover their short positions and will definitely help fuel asos stock price growth technical analysis aso has been following a strict channel since its ipo in october as seen below it has bounced off support and resistance multiple times but still remains in this channel aso is currently hitting the bottom of the channel and i believe it will

lx6wl6,None,N/A,unfi dd,DD,49,0.81,reddit_eats_tidepods,43,tldr unfi 💎👐🚀🌕 ive been watching unfi for about years now this post is going to be very basic as the last unfi dd post i read had lots of good information theres no point in repeating the same arguments i have a parttime job at a grocery store for insurance over the last four years ive been watching unfi increase their market share and product offerings while the stock price plummeted early on i noticed a large short interest currently its around and has been for quite some time you have to ask yourself why would there be a large short interest throughout a pandemic for a dine at home stock one could certainly argue the mismanaged acquisition of svu greatly contributed to this however something that i have not heard mentioned in any due diligence report on unfi is the lawsuit against goldman sachs for the unfair terms of the loan it was around this period in time that i began to notice how large is the short interest was it is my guess and opinion because of this lawsuit unfi is being punished by way of short interest i have not heard anyone mention this as a potential reason for such a high short interest during the last four years i have seen unfi gobble up a significant amount of brands increasing their distribution to our store from about of our product offering line to well over dont take my word for it you can go into any grocery store and look at the tag on the shelf and it will tell you which distributor the product comes from if youve been paying attention to this and who would you would find a consistent increase in their market share in fact recently they acquired qfc locations in my area this tells me more than any potential amazon contract i in fact dont care whether or not they get the amazon go stores because i think those will flop in the longterm that being said a lot of people are looking at the amazon contract as a sign of success and its my opinion that they will retain that contract but i couldnt care less let us know talk cerebrally about their shipping issues recently i saw three drivers unloading a unfi truck and i jokingly asked them if they were union drivers having three people control one truck they responded by saying no they were training new drivers from jb hunt to deliver their products in my area this replaces a complicated intricate system of independent owner operators consolidating their shipping costs into one account as opposed to hundreds of accounts is going to save them a lot of money my bottom line is that unfi continually increases their market share and the synergies will be realized from the svu acquisition in fairly short order this is my yolo play and im planning on holding it upwards of $ a share my guess is that we could reach over $ a share within two years as you can see in my previous post i hold shares if i could create a gif for this stock it would be a turtle with a rocket strapped to its back on a skateboard someone posted this exact gif on yahoo finance board and it is so accurate i feel very comfortable with this stock and although i check it multiple times a day its not something that i need to do i sleep like a baby at night one thing that i will caution yall about is the earnings reports never send the stock skyrocketing in fact last earnings report they crushed it and their stock did absolutely nothing over the week after earnings this is of absolutely no concern to me when you have a high short interest and low volume trading this sort of thing is to be expected a negative point about this company very important to include in an unbiased assessment is the general silence from the board about what theyre doing however im looking at this through the lens of theyre too busy expanding their business instead of making hyped up press releases and this just gives me more confidence in the stock for the mid and longterm this is the way,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx6wl6/unfi_dd/,1614747600

easternarabic listeners and artists anghami has been recently acquired and is planned to ipo on the nasdaq in making it the first arab tech company to be traded on the nasdaq ampxb user breakdown anghami currently has million active users compared to their q user base which was million at the time that is a increase anghami for contrast in this same time frame spotify went from million active users to active users a increase spotify ampxb recent acquisition just very recently it was announced that acquisition company vistas media capital alongside shuaainvestment banking a uae based asset management and investment firm have both committed $ million $ million vistas $million shuaainvestment to effectively merge anghami with vistas media capital ampxb vistas media capital the blank check company ipod last august with an initial pricing of $ and a volume of m i cant find much on previous activities of this company prior to or even after the ipo beyond this merger it does not seem like they have done much heres the company mission statement vistas media acquisition company inc nasdaqvmacu “vmac” or the “company” is a blank check company also commonly referred to as a special purpose acquisition company or spac formed for the purpose of effecting a merger share exchange asset acquisition share purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities in the global media and entertainment sector the company intends to identify a target business in the global media amp entertainment sector past their ipo they kept trading sideways at around $ with occasional dips and peaks hitting a w low at and a high of vmacu vistas media acquisition ampxb shuaacapital this is where things get a bit fucky from my end due to this being the uae market and in dirham the local currency there i tried my best to synthesize what little information i could find and come to some sort of conclusion on them first off shuaa is a united arab emiratesbased company engaged in the provision of financial and investment services the company is organized into five segments the asset management segment manages conventional equity debt and money market as well as shariah compliant portfolios and investment funds using both active and passive management styles the investment banking segment provides corporate finance advisory private placements public offerings of equity and debt securities among others the brokerage segment operates under the brand of shuaa securities and acts as principal and agent providing custody and clearing services to clients providing access to regional exchanges some interesting figures and news pertaining to shuaacapital they were up in profits in and they won two awards asset management company of the year and best investment bank in mena not sure whos giving out these awards but hey good for shuaa publicity is publicity as i mentioned they are far better established than vmacu already trading on the dubai financial market for the past years its essentially a penny stock with a high of aed usd and currently trading sideways at around aed usd shuaa capital investor relations $shuaa btw i joined shuaacapital even though they are two seperate words just so the automod doesnt freak over the penny stock mention ampxb my moves so even though the acquisition isnt by catalysts big enough to singlehandedly cause a stir i am still very bullish simply due to the hold anghami has in that sector some westernized middle easterners may use spotify or other similar services but what you need to know is the biggest market to hit on is not the same demographic as a middle eastern reddit user to expand on this across various social circles in the middle east and surrounding countries the technology and platforms used also vary significantly more specifically for example a kid from egypt that went to a private school and talks english with his friends and mainly listens to rap and not egyptian music is not the demographic but he is also not the majority in these locales the majority is public schooled people who are not as westernized and mainly listen to egyptian for the sake of our example and similar music from the surrounding culture this exact market is what anghami has completely nailed none of the people who purely want to listen to their regional artists and music will go to any other platform than anghami as a person with a middle eastern background trust me this app is the one taking over in this field kind of similar to how jumia is also taking over the online ordering market by sculpting their services for the areas in which they are offered i would not be surprised if some lowgrade mobile companies team up and have it as a default app for phones sold in this region generally just lots of potential and the team behind the main app has been very good in stimulating growth anghami to merge with vistas about anghami they are looking to ipo in late q of and in my opinion they can only really go up from there interested to hear everyone elses thoughts not financial advice do your own research i just like the songs

lx0ls8,RKT,-45.31%,rkt is being pushed as a distraction from gme a quantitative analysis,Discussion,1895,0.82,pdwp90,725,edit based on the fact that a number of comments seem to have been made without reading beyond the first words of the title and the fact that this is sitting at upvoted id encourage you to at least read to the tldr i usually stick to providing raw data but this post has a little bit of added analysis i dont own $gme or $rkt i dont actively invest to avoid accusations of bias in my data and dont like either stock over the other i do like wsb though and dont like baseless conspiracy theories and i have seen a lot of conspiracy theories flying around wsb recently without much evidence to accompany them most recently i got flooded by comments like this on my data post yesterday comments ampxb the goal of this post was to look at one of those theories and see if i can provide a base for it the theory in question is “$rkt discussion is being artificially pushed to distract from $gme” a tldr of my analysis is a both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb b accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt c there are a small but nonzero number of people trying to artificially manipulate discussion to get others to sell $gme however this is done with no relation to $rkt d accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks through my analysis i wasnt able to find any solid evidence of $rkt being artificially pushed as a distraction from $gme while its easy to complain about uzjzs ironfisted bot army i think it deserves a lot of credit for curbing attempts at manipulation now i will provide the data backing up these conclusions and call out one account i did find attempting to artificially manipulate discussion ampxb both $rkt and $gme are being discussed by a lot of accounts that are new to posting on wsb accounts discussing $gme are actually newer to wsb on average than accounts discussing $rkt i dont think i need to patronize you with a bunch of facts and figures showing how much attention has been drawn to wsb recently obviously this attention came with a lot of new posters and thats fully on display when we look at when accounts talking about $gme and $rkt first joined the wsb community the motive behind looking at these numbers was to determine whether there were a bunch of new accounts who joined the community with the sole purpose of distracting from $gme the average $rkt poster first posted on wsb on december th this is pretty shockingly young but the average $gme poster is even newer to the community with an average date of december nd here are histograms showing when the accounts mentioning both stocks first joined the community by year rkt histogram gme histogram ampxb there is a nonzero number of people trying to manipulate discussion to get others to sell $gme but not enough to have a significant effect one other thing i examined was how much different accounts were shilling $gme and $rkt for the most part there wasnt too much spam of either ticker by individual accounts with a few notable exceptions below are scatter plots showing accounts with the date they joined wsb on the xaxis and the number of times they have mentioned $gme$rkt in the last days on the yaxis $gme date joined vs mentions $rkt date joined vs mentions there are prominent outliers that i will examine one of which i think probably deserves some sort of moderator action on the $gme graph we have ucharg way out in the upper right he just started posting on here yesterday and has been just absolutely spamming antigme shit since although posts like sell you gme stock seem to match the grammar and speech patterns expected of a shortonly investor i dont really see this single example as solid evidence of a larger artificial antigme push on the $rkt side of things we have two accounts that are pretty clearly tied to real people so i dont want to call them out by username while id say theyre pretty clearly innocent of being hedge fund accounts old accounts lots of personal info lots of nonwsb posts theyre absolutely guilty of living in the discussion threads with dozens of comments already today you could probably make an argument that someone commenting about $rkt all day long is having some impact on the overall discussion but given that its just two random dudes i kind of doubt it has much of an effect in the grand scheme of things accounts mentioning $gme and $rkt behave similarly in promoting the respective stocks the last thing i wanted to look at was how accounts behaved in promoting $gme and $rkt in particular i wanted to see if accounts mentioning either stock were more likely to mention it repeatedly i ended up not finding much of a significant difference below is a table where $gme$rkt accounts are defined as accounts mentioning each respective stock ampxb mentions of $rkt$gme over last days$rkt accounts$gme accounts gt gt gt gt ampxb theres a pretty small overlap between people talking about $gme and people talking about $rkt likely leading to some of the conflict that we have seen but from my research i wasnt able to find any solid evidence of $rkt being artificially pushed as a distraction from $gme that being said

lxbw9p,GME,34.00%,gme dd hf cant cover their short by the call options,DD,188,0.87,Federal-Percentage-8,139,disclaim not financial advice first i am an international student so my grammar isnt great apologize for that first i see many people quoting the options volume trading volume is the number of shares or contracts traded in a given period and open interest is the total number of option contracts that are currently out there these contracts have been traded but not yet liquidated by an offsetting trade or an exercise or assignment if we are looking for a call chain exercise to cause the gamma squeeze we should look at the open interest because those are the options not being exercised or offset i see a lot of saying that hf can cover their entire short position by buying huge call options to cover their short position and become longsided first if they choose to close their position by call option it would be more expensive than buying a regular share in the market because you need to pay the premium they may have some hedge option for their short position but there would always be more expensive to cover their short position by call option even they choose to do so it would likely be done when gme falls to the range which is the cheapest time to buy a call option in the past two weeks most of the call options are open last week or this week which is super expensive consider the iv i think they didnt even think about covering at a loss then lets take a look at the call option that expires in mar call options are open and call options are in the money and only the options itm would be exercised which only million shares let make a minimum assumption that the short position they hold is of the float according to finra which is mm short position so if they exercise those call options which only cover of their short position it would collapse their whole shot position by interest market price by i didnt put the following call options into consideration because there is no point cover their short position multiple times which could hugely inflate their losses so call options cant be a good way for them to cover please correct me if i have any mistakes position edit also they may cover some of their position on the first runup and short it again when gme falling but remember that the short borrow interest is as high as over they lost money for sure and the interest rate also becomes higher which makes the second runup worse for them 💎💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🚀 edit for those who dont know how option pricing here is the thing the more call hf purchase the more iv it is and the option price shoots up also ampxb ampxb,2021-03-03,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxbw9p/gme_dd_hf_cant_cover_their_short_by_the_call/,1614747600
lwnfwh,None,N/A,costco no really when you need a profitable place to land after jumping from the tech train,DD,223,0.88,bcell4u,287,alright so let me start off by mentioning that im a long time lurker first time poster in wsb and thought it time to make my first contribution i know i know i didnt think my first contribution would be about a jim cramer boomer stock but yea it really is but just follow along with me here i first began the day planning out my next moves for when i start jumping off the tech train like right about now and begin embracing the market for post pandemic retaillife and once the cpi begins to bump the moves for making money in the market during inflation this led me to look at commodities and companies which deals with commodities enter costco i then pull up cost and wonder what the heck am i looking at why is there such a dip ampxb there must have been some terrible news right being an avid costco shopper to feed my family of i begin researching what terrible thing happened to costco to cause such a rapid selloff but the more i looked the more i realized that this selloff is really just weirdand it could be an opportunity to get some tendiesor rotisserie chickenssee what i did there researching possible causes could it be massive shorting like we all see with other stocks no its only running of shares shorted ampxb was there any news of accidents or management issues none that i could find on google then i come across an article about warren buffet which may explain some things warren buffet sells his shares of costco dot yahoo dot comlifestylewarrenbuffettdumpsallhiscostcostockreasonswhythatisabigsurprisehtml well considering that he sold it off prior to november th could it have been him doing that huge red candle on nov th shouldnt the stock have begun to drop from there it should have but it didnt so i looked some more and found that costco announced a special $ dividend which is pretty highi mean rkt announced a $ div and thought that was amazing my first thought was that damn costco made a lot of money to do a $ dividend and second that this drop isnt justified if costco is making a ton of money dot yahoo dot comnewssupermarketchaincostcodeclaresspecialhtml heres a chart with the dividend marked you can also see that big red candle right before it which could have been buffet ampxb as you can see right after the dividend has passed the stock begins a slow bleed until you see the final crazy selloff at the end and with that $ dividend in the back of my head im already thinking that this sell off is all sentiment without any real reason so i do some due diligence and look at the financials earning calls etc i then mark them on the chart to see what kind of effect those things had on the price they seemed to help or negate the stock even during this time of speculative hype ampxb each blue vertical line marks an earnings call where if you zoom in close enough you can easily see the market respond negatively or positively to the results in a pretty normal fashion within a week or so afterwards each call is followed by a swing of about points up or points down typical moves for a stock trading in the hundreds this confirms to me that without a trigger to drop the price of costco there really isnt any reason why the stock is dropping and that any positive earnings should push it back up and any negative earnings should drop it further or remain the same ampxb as you can see the stock is just completely oversold trading outside the bollinger bands which tells me that it might be a good time to catch a falling knife you know buy the dipbut what could slow the downfall and even reverse it enter the earnings call march th and why i am bullish looking through the financials costco has continuously beat its earnings gtthis warehouse club operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates especially when looking at the previous two reports the average surprise for the last two quarters was gt gtfor the most recent quarter costco was expected to post earnings of $ per share but it reported $ per share instead representing a surprise of for the previous quarter the consensus estimate was $ per share while it actually produced $ per share a surprise of dot yahoo dot comcostcocostbeatestimatesagainhtml and looking at its previous years of march earnings it has always beat its december earnings for all you call options people i didnt do a screen capture as its a long scroll but the data is on the link below just look at all the march earnings vs the one reported before it dot marketbeat dot comstocksnasdaqcostearnings the most recent price target estimate i could easily google all above where its trading now ampxb fundamentals if they matter anymore have not changed and why i like this stock they make a ton of money selling tendies gtin fy ended august costco posted yearoveryear yoy gains in revenue net income and other metrics total revenue increased by yoy while net income attributable to costco climbed by yoy﻿ the company said that its ecommerce business saw a yoy increase in sales for fy as a result of gains in grocery deliveries

also making tendies gtbesides the us and canada costco operates membership warehouses in mexico the uk japan korea spain australia france china and iceland and these latter countries are represented in the other international operations segment together the nonus and noncanadian countries represent roughly the same amount of revenue and operating income as the companys canadian business for q fy other international operations generated total revenue of about $ billion a yoy increase other international operations also posted q fy operating income of $ million a yoy increase this makes this segment the fastestgrowing in terms of both total revenue and operating income it comprises of revenue and of operating income dot investopedia dot comhowcostcomakesmoney why costco post pandemic will still retain its customers article from gtnearly all the members who had the opportunity to cancel their subscriptions last quarter declined to do so a full of its us shopper base chose to renew in fact which marks a slight increase from the that costco reported in each of the last three quarters costco counted million member households at the end of q up compared to the prior quarter its global renewal rate was unchanged at dot fool dot cominvestingwhyalmostnoonecancelingcostcomembershipaspx costco is a solid business with much upside despite buffet selling he also dumped aapl the fundamentals of the business have not changed seeing as that the majority of its profits come from the membership itself and that most people do not cancel their memberships i dont see why costco would suffer post covid at the recent price its currently at it signals an overly sold stock which will very likely bump up in the next earnings call to stabilize the price and bring it back into traction my plan i like this stock for both a long hold and will supplement with $ march th sound familiar calls ill have shares come market open tomorrow edit fat fingered march th instead of march

lxqr88,None,N/A,the combined case for cameco nyseccj tsxcco and fluor corp nyseflr,DD,8,0.63,_count_dooku,24,disclaimer i have calls on both of these and this is my investment thesis tldr fluors nuscale should speed up the development and rollout of smrs and cameco should be able to sell more uranium to america as the smr technology becomes more widely adopted cameco uranium corp tsecco nyseccj produces of the worlds uranium fluor corp nyseflr instrumental in the rampd of small modular reactors through its subsidiary nuscale smrs have been approved by regulators in utah regulatory hurdles still exist but this is largely due to varying regulatory regimes between countries there has been a strong push for harmonization over recent years due to these inconsistencies but my focus is mainly for use cases within the us nuscale also operates in the rare earth metals sector which like uranium is critical to economic and national security cameco corp is the second largest uranium miner in the world based in canada we have around of the worlds uranium number one asset is its cigar lake mine which has been shut down since mid due to covid with the vaccine rollout coming the company would benefit from a strong infusion of cash to quickly restart operations at the mine they have a supply contract with a chinese utility but because of their production issues theyre being forced to buy and sell uranium at spot prices to honor the contract this isnt sustainable and puts the uranium industry in north america at risk because cameco due to the mine closure is unhedged against a jump in uranium spot prices to make matters worse a chinese soe has recently taken equity in kazatomprom worlds largest uranium producer state owned by kazakhstan with china holding the minority interest this means that for every dollar paid for kazatomproms uranium china makes cents and cameco loses potential market share even though it is under obligation to fulfill its supply contract to the chinese regardless of limited production due to the mine shutdown the good news here is that a new technology is on the horizon a technology called small modular reactors which have already received regulatory approval in some states these are nuclear fission reactors that are much smaller more efficient and safer than traditional reactors due to these factors the upfront cost of integrating these smrs into a broader modernized nuclear infrastructure could be much lower due to shorter project time horizons lower material costs relative to potential energy yields and thus less uncertaintyrisk being newer and more efficient technology also results in less cash burn traditionally the initial investments in nuclear power have come from the government because private investors were uncomfortable with the project time horizons and initial costs this can change now with the opportunity provided by smrs the current us nuclear infrastructure relies largely on plutonium inputs and is generally old tech that has been around for decades but smrs can run on uranium that undergoes a much less costly enrichment process prior to use plutonium is mainly manufactured in nuclear reactors from fissioning uranium due to its lack of natural abundance if the market can guide a wider push to modernize the us nuclear infrastructure through adoption of smrs cameco would be the ideal supplier of uranium to power those reactors as it wouldnt have to be converted into to plutonium first just slightly enriched the alternative is buying from kazatomprom and giving money to china every time you turn the lights on energy security is national security sure depending on canada for uranium isnt as great as relying on your own supplies but the us doesnt domestically produce enough uranium to make that feasible canada is a loyal us ally and our nuclear sector overall employs and contracts many engineers and national security experts from the us navy given the times and the geopoliticalgeoeconomic dynamic between china and western powers it makes sense for america to cooperate with its allies on critical infrastructure security and development particularly with regards to sensitive and regulated sectors like nuclear power and rare earth metals development in summary buy cameco buy flour invest in a secure and prosperous future for the north american continent dont let chinas soes take over the world theyre not here to help your businesses theyre here to get leverage over critical infrastructure and resources in your economy to secure longterm commodity supplies for the chinese state kind of like the east india company minus the wigs and funny hats they probably have some mercenaries though or pmcs under contract but theres not a huge difference,2021-03-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lxqr88/the_combined_case_for_cameco_nyseccj_tsxcco_and/,1614834000

lxt0bx,None,N/A,updated ravi trading guide,Chart,9,0.69,SpicySlavic,5,after testing ravi indicator for about weeks making mistakes and looking into them i decided to make an improved updated guide so others who discovered this from me wont make the same mistakes that might cost them big ammounts of money the guide has no attempts at the big funny and just focuses on being simple ro read this is an infraday indicator for day tradingscalping so just like last time a step by step which stocks to trade not all stocks work with ravi in fact most probably wont there are strict requirements to guarantee daily profits here they are volatility a stock must move in at least a daily range on previous days volume a stock must have good regular ammounts of volume for the majority of the first half of the day if you see that a stock has abysmal volume yesterday its a good idea to not trade it today indecisiveness ravi is great at predicting when a stock is hitting a floor or a ceiling so the more ups and downs is has the better if a stock is gradually growing nonstop infraday it damages accuracy of the indicator severely it would still be mostly accurate but a risk of a big loss would be looming at any time ampxb perfect environment for ravi trades how to enter once you turn on ravi indicator available on etoro charts and yahoo finance make sure to leave the default settings on the indicator mostly has white lines once one of them becomes red or green it is a signal for entry go long on red lines and go short on green lines respectively split your money never go all in on the first candle my most effective strategy is to split your money in parts explained below do not enter in the first minutes of the market open no matter the conditions market go ape shit and you never know what to expect trading ravi in this time is very risky if you see a stock with big volume on market open while yesterday has bad volume in the nd half of the day ignore ravi for minutes if the opening price has made a big jump since yesterdays close ignore it for minutes as well do not stack the ignoring periods on the ravi indicator you can see two thresholds usually a and which are used to calculate entries if a market opens already crossing the thresholds and stays there for a while ignore this stock for today or increase the thresholds the last option relies purely on experience and has minor risks do not enter into a position until the signalling candle finishes forming it could become even more signalling or stop being signalling completely in seconds split your money this isnt rocket science nor did i come up with this but with ravi it is essential to prevent losses and increase yields split your money in when entering a trade example you see a redbuy signal and go long with but it keeps going lower once it goes lower significantly enter again with another rd of your money you now have invested this is will increase your overall profits and allow you to break even on otherwise losing trades it is very important and saved my ass countless times during testing once the price bounces exit for a profit at your personal choice mine is total gain per single trade both entries count as trade at last the other of your money remaining is to be reserved for an emergency the price could continue to go lower for a short time potentially making the trade negative even after pullback if you see that situation use the last rd of the money to enter for one last time defending your position and exit as soon as the position breaks even dont wait for profits if you invested of your money this is however quite rare and becomes even more rare with experience ampxb an example of risk management entries with ravi with other indicators this strategy actually increases risks but not with this one it does the opposite this particular trade is the one i had the bad luck to fall into today when mr jpow had the entire market nosedive for about minutes and i was clueless regardless i ended up benefiting from the trade anyways how to exit this is the biggest difference from my first guide not gonna lie it was kinda retarded and i ended up losing money because of it here is a much better version tested for more than a week since then number one rule of trading this indicator dont be greedy from looking at countless tickers and situations i concluded that the vast majority of trades yield a before becoming risky and risk management is insanely important with ravi yes its not massive but you will only need about trades a day for a daily gain a respectable daily goal for professional day traders with only k money in the game it gives you $ per day or $ per month work days if you had to do three entries of your money exit as soon as you break even net total not on each individual entry entry trades are quite rare and usually related to bad news causing unexpectedly big moves when news ruin a trade you can still sometimes benefit from it but it is generally safe to exit breaking even just remember than when you have all of your money in the trade you have no more capital left to defend your position in case of a failure and if after breaking even the price begins to go opposite again youre fucked ampxb additional tips in very rare situations you might have a weakening signal during a trade without confirmation i couldnt find examples on charts since it happened to me more than a week ago so here is a hypothetical example ampxb self explanatory but anyways you go long price goes even lower but at the same time signal is becoming weaker which means that it will be extremely hard to return to levels to profit from the initial entry if you used the times splitting strategy you are likely to still escape losses or even profit but that is up to your risk management the best way is to exit these trades as soon as you can when you spot them dont be a pussy sometimes price will continue to go against ravi signals but do not be scared and do not exit for a loss unless you see one of the situations mentioned above hodl is actually a valuable advice with here do not trade last hours of the market even if the volume is acceptable you might get caught in a trade that will have to be finished tomorrow a massive risk to take always remember indecisive stocks best stocks always check for news you do not want any big news before you start trading as they usually drive price in only direction and its hard to profit from them with ravi be careful when entering on signals if they happen on retests of a very recent supportresistance you could get yourself into a very risky situation although splitting your money will usually save you regardless do not use this indicator for any other methods of trading it works awfully with hour day candles as well as being completely useless with creep toe hi mods because of the spread other people suggested more uses for ravi but i did not test them ampxb ps the entire guide comes from my personal experience if you see a mistake prevention tip here it is because i lost money and learned how to avoid it next time with this current version of the guide i have

lxq24n,UWMC,-19.85%,united wholesale mortgage $uwmc bull thesis from a real estate professional,DD,1080,0.78,MadeToOrderName,465,ive been building a position in united wholesale mortgage $uwmc for months now since their merger was announced and with these prices i decided to offer some dd to any members of this sub with the ability to hold more than one stonk in their portfolio tldr uwmc is better than rkt and i think its better for both the shortterm traders and the longhold investors i have read a lot of great analysis of their financials all over reddit recently so i wont bore with too many details but the high altitude view goes as follows went public with a $b valuation based on only three quarters of x multiple on adjusted income in q alone they did $b in net income which means their q reporting towards the end of april is going to be massive at todays price the dividend yield is over annually exdividend date is this coming tuesday meaning if youre going to buy do it before tuesday march th it was announced this week theyll be included in the russell and russell index beginning march nd which means extra buying necessity between now and earnings for the semiretarded members here this means tons of net buying between now and march nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup ampxb now as a realtor id like to add some professional analysis here and ill touch on rkt briefly too because theyre being compared a lot due to sector similarity but their models are totally different ampxb it doesnt matter what mortgage rates are mortgage originators always make x margin on every loan they sell what matters is the number of purchases and refis ie how many widgets they sell nationwide there is a massive shortage of housing supply because people are simply not moving which means when things return to normal well see x x x and in some markets even x the number of homes being sold which translates to the same number of new loans being originated profits are way higher on new purchases vs refis so while nobody is turning refis down their marketing dollars are spent generating loans on new purchases anybody who tuned in to uwmcs final sales call of for their national reps heard their ceo matt ishba talking about how theyd spend the money theyd get from going public and he was all about relationships relationships with realtors particularly but also with other real estate spheres in influence insurance agents title companies etc rkt has great market share but realtors hate when clients consider using them because they frequently take way longer to close a loan than what is considered normal weeks right now originators like the salespeople working through uwmc have a major competitive advantage against rocket and others because they close deals fast that is all that matters to realtors and realtors are often the person that is pointing people in the direction of the lending option rkt may get a lot of market share for refis the lower profitability loans but uwmc is poised to get a growing share of higher profit new purchase volume especially as supply of homes for sale new and preowned increases to meet demand now anybody who has either considered selling a home recently or buying a home recently knows this but for those not in those categories the real estate market is insane right now think melvin capital scrounging for gme shares to cover their shorts in the biggest gamma squeeze cycle ever insane mediocre homes are selling for over asking price within days of hitting the market and buyers are fomoing hardcore into paying these escalating prices thats a great thing for sellers but doesnt do anything good or bad for uwmc holders ampxb this is what matters for uwmc investors as inventory increases which it will because in some states covid made it near impossible to sell in and as prices become to normalize causing more people to want to move because it wont be insanely expensive on the buy side the volume of high profit loans for new purchases will increase again it doesnt matter if interest rates go up a little its not like theyre going to double interest rates are at all time lows as seen here from freddie mac and that isnt going to change for years to come uwmc pays a regular dividend is about to announce an insane q on or around april rd and since theyre the largest originator of loans in the country they will absolutely see a rising price moving forward into shortterm traders best bet for you is to buy slightly otm april or may calls personally id buy may calls but with the intention of selling them during the earnings runup if that happens andor holding them through er if the runup isnt significant enough due to the markets overall vibe right now buying may calls gives you extra insurance which i like but degens should stick to april and save the premim long term investors at current prices between $share today if youre not buying now than there is no helping you ive bought at levels as low as $ and as high as $ and im comfortable anywhere in that range i dont think a price of $ by years end is unreasonable once the company has steady quarterly growth figures for bigger investors to buy in with i believe well see over $share only if the market as a whole starts humming along and only if local home sale inventory returns to levels and id guesstimate that is shot tldr again tons of net buying between now and march nd because of index inclusion dividend bonus and earnings runup in april ampxb proof of my share position ampxb my buy orders today are set shares $ filled shares $ filled shares $ shares $ shares $ ampxb again this is just the bull thesis i think a few decent bearish points have been made elsewhere that i can get behind but most have to deal with mortgages being unsexy or the company being young and untested well making money is sexy to me i dont know about you fruits most of the members here are young and untested too probably spreading stis all over your local areas via grinder before covid good luck to all happy trading and lets expand our horizons a little like the old days of wsb ampxb edit uelsandavid was kind enough to point out below that a director recently bought shares on march st and the average analyst rating is $ edit adding this amazing article where the ceo of uwm matt ishbia walked into the room for his facebook live broadcast to uwms brokers unzipped his pants whipped his thing out smacked them around a little bit and zipped back up and dropped the mic tldr he told uwm

lxvjxv,None,N/A,banneddiscontinued book investing,DD,171,0.91,Polytroposphere,117,youve probably heard the news by now that dr seuss books will no longer be published for imagery that has been deemed racist regardless of your political beliefs were all here to make money basic supply and demand indicates that discontinued books will skyrocket in value if demand increases sure enough within two days these banned dr seuss books are now worth their weight in fucking gold heres a breakdown by numbers im using data from barnes and noble online to establish the normal hardcover price and then the lowest price on amazon to establish approximate selling price after it was announced that they will no longer be published the cats quizzer $ gt $ increase if i ran the zoo $ gt $ increase on beyond zebra $ gt $ increase scrambled eggs super $ gt $ increase mcelligots pool $ gt $ increase and to think that i saw it on mulberry street $ gt $ increase every single one of these is a literal tenbagger whats even more crazy is that this insider article sort of called it almost two years ago—the first book on their list is if i ran the zoo in addition to the above mentioned insider article i looked through several lists of books that are being challenged for racial content my analysis leads me to believe that the indian in the cupboard by lynne reid banks currently being published by harper collins is a prime candidate for a discontinued book squeeze heres why low search volume heres a google trends graph of how often the recalled dr seuss books were searched for on amazon notice how theres nobody trying to buy these books this makes sense no publisher in their right mind would discontinue a popular childrens book this is why books like the cat in the hat or peter pan which have also been criticized will never go out of print it would be a financial nightmare in contrast look at how indian in the cupboard stacks up against some other contenders ampxb if you follow the red trendline you will see that searches for indian in the cupboard amazon are effectively with some slight upticks every now and then this contrasts with amazon searches for titles like little house on the prairie which sees consistent search frequency discontinuing further printings of the indian in the cupboard will probably have little impact on harpercollins margins broad readership base particularly among middleaged readers in addition to being discontinued a book will need to have excess demand before the price will surge this will happen only if the book has a broad readership base in dr seusss case so many adults have probably read at least one of the discontinued books growing up hell i loved mulberry street when i was little which is why theyre actually buying up these books now that theyve become limited edition items it probably helps that dr seuss wrote his books to help children read and literally every elementary school still uses his writing to teach literacy skills similarly the indian in the cupboard was actually wellreceived in the s and was incorporated into school curriculums nationwide you can still find entire teaching guides built around the indian in the cupboard and i distinctly remember reading this book and filling out worksheets back in third grade yeah this book isnt as popular as it once was but im willing to bet that in the years that its been out its been able to build a solid fanbase of readers who will buy a copy out of nostalgia once this book gets banned this also gives the indian in the cupboard an advantage over books like pippi longstocking which—despite being a childrens book with low search volume—is beloved in sweden but has a much smaller audience in america history of contentious debate the controversy over dr seusss books didnt just happen overnight although it certainly felt that way his books have been banned in libraries for years and there are arguments going all the way back to the s about whether his books are racist this is the same situation that the indian in the cupboard finds itself in its been removed from numerous public libraries and the american library association leadership advised educators to avoid the book as far back as this is important because the decision to remove books is typically timesensitive given almost years to consider whether or not to discontinue publishing harper collins likely has enough financial data and a good picture of consumer preferences especially under the current political climate to decide that they will stop further publications of the indian in the cupboard its important to keep in mind that there is significantly less liquidity with trading books than stocks however books are still less volatile and like art pieces tend to appreciate in value over time i think that the indian in the cupboard is a longterm hold which has the potential to increase ten fold when it inevitably gets pulled from

the last trading sessions and since the ath days ago and now has a market cap of $b this is an enormous overreaction for a company that has reported the highest efficacy to date against the original covid variant and has several billions of dollars in advanced purchase agreements for if trading at close to x pricesales anticipated isnt enough nvax is also the most well positioned vaccine maker to capitalize on the future booster market due to the ability to combine multiple strains in one shot and their excellent safety profile nvax is an incredible deal right now at $share refer to my previous posts for more background and a more thorough explanation of nvaxs vaccine particularly my last post on recap of how we got here on january th nvax reported best in class interim results from their phase uk trial efficacy against original covid variant which led to shares massively increasing over the following couple of weeks peaking at over $share see summary figure from ra capital below outlining nvaxs vaccine performance against the competition since then several advanced purchased agreements have been confirmedfinalized and nvax has secured orders for m doses which ceo has indicated will be $dose additionally nvax has confirmed agreements for b doses that will be supplied through exclusive license agreements with japan south korea and indiacovax nvax completed enrollment for usmexico phase trial on february nd and will likely report interim results in march earnings on march st provided several important updates around manufacturing and development of a new bivalent covid vaccine however the market reacted negatively likely due to expectations around an update for the uk phase trial completion and us eua shares continued to slide over the last days due to broader market conditions closing at $share today nvax remains well positioned despite being behind pfe mrna and jnj based on several comments ive seen over the past few days it seems that many people are not aware that there is a massive market for covid vaccines outside of the us and that nvax already has an agreement with the us to provide m doses yes the us is vaccinating millions of people every week but weve known for months that nvax was going to be approved after pfemrnajnj and nothing has changed on that front for the first wave of vaccinations the us market was never going to be the major revenue generator for nvax it was always going to be about the exus market for as of today nvax has advanced purchase agreements with the following countries that will likely pay top tier pricing which ceo suggested earlier this week will be $dose canada m doses w option for additional m doses uk m doses australia m doses w option for additional m doses new zealand m doses switzerland m doses this does not include ongoing negotiations with the eu which have been reported to involve supplying m doses with an option for another m there will almost certainly be several more countries that come forward with purchases in the coming weeks during the earnings call on monday ceo confirmed that all manufacturing sites are making gmp product with us and sk performing final fill this is an important update and it appears that manufacturing will be able to deliver on projected supply of m dosesmonth once all sites are fully operational in mid ampxb new covid variants p amp b can escape prior immunity to original covid variants and vaccination with stgeneration covid vaccines several lines of evidence make it clear that at least two of the covid variants in circulation are capable of immune escape this is a big deal because it means that existing vaccines will be less effective as weve already seen and will need to be updated in the future it also isnt hard to imagine that in another months after more of the population has been vaccinated that selection pressure will generate additional escape mutants that well need to think about ultimately this means that were very likely going to need updated covid vaccines with some level of frequency nvax and mrna are already working on bivalent formulations that will cover at least two variants and theres very good reason to think there will be more updates in the next few years due to the nature of their vaccine platform nvax is best positioned to take advantage of updated booster shots in the future i went through this in more detail in my last post but to summarize nvaxs high potency allows them to use a very low dose of protein µg in their current formulation and they tested up to µg during phase trials with no change in side effects as a result they have the “space” to add coverage against several additional variants and have confirmed that theyre already working on this pfemrna have much less “space” to add coverage against additional variants due to dose limiting toxicity as theyre already relatively close to the ceiling of how much mrna can be delivered in a dose without causing unacceptable levels of toxicity safety issues are already a concern with the existing formulation particularly for mrna which was the subject of a recent new england journal of medicine paper nejm paper consequently mrnas bivalent booster is being developed to cover two variants at half of the original dose to keep the total mrna at µg still safety remains a concern since we see an increase in side effects going from dose to dose due to an unknown mechanism and there are concerns that there will be a similar issue going from dose to dose jnj and azns platform use adenoviral vector platform to deliver the dna sequence encoding the antigen both suffer from the same problem which is that the immune system recognizes the vector and impairs the efficacy of subsequent vaccinations ampxb nvax will be able to leverage their best in class platform against new variants and will be able to take advantage of an expedited pathway to get updated formulations approved in the future based on recent fda guidance link as a result future trials will be able to take place much faster and the speed advantage for mrnabased platforms will be significantly negated compared to the first round of trials nvax is undervalued at $share even before considering how massive the revenues for boosters could be nvax is insanely cheap at an $b market cap i havent performed any financial modeling so im not going to give a price target beyond saying its much higher than $ instead ill point you to the only four analysts whove provided updated price targets since earnings on

and bntx have market caps of $b and $b respectively cvac has no approved products and a covid vaccine that appears significantly less effective and is at an earlier phase of development bntx is the inventor of pfes vaccine and shares revenue with pfe yes both cvac and bntx are getting a premium for their pipelines but nvax has a pipeline as well with a flu vaccine that successfully completed phase prior to the pandemic and an rsv vaccine in clinical development both of which are candidates to be made into combination vaccines with their covid vaccine ampxb positions shares $ $ $ bought on

m3i8kc,None,N/A,how to keep your newly minted title of millionaire,Discussion,8,0.9,Goaliescottie,1027,so you did it you did your due diligence you did the math you summoned your courage to press that buy button and now those stocks and options have granted you a title you only dreamed of having millionaire congratulations you beat the odds that so many before you have failed to overcome you played the game and came out on top now its time to buy that house you always dreamed of or that car you always wanted to drive right sure if you want to lose your title of millionaire however if you d like to stay a millionaire there are some things you may like to consider this is not financial advice but rather pieces of life suggestions a survival guide so to speak of the next months and how to protect your new title ampxb first protect it from everyone else dont tell anybody if there is one thing you take away from this let it be this so let me repeat that dont tell anyone this is going to be your most well kept secret in your life you will probably feel the urge to tell your friends and your family but doing this will ruin your life why well everyone is gonna want a cut theyre gonna say they need that new device or they need that new car or they need this or that theyll bring up how far you go back suddenly youll see the very people who have been your friends turn on you like vultures they may think they have your best interests in mind and they may not the harm theyre causing but theyll smell money and theyre gonna come asking in that case youve gotta be the bad guy youve gotta be the one to say no and friendships are going to quickly fall apart as you deny them or youre gonna bleed your money helping everyone while they take advantage of you and indulge their overspending habits to put it differently this isnt a question of who do you tell because word spreads rather this is a question of social survival do you want to maintain your relationship with your friends and family yes then keep it to yourself money talks but wealth whispers ampxb second protect it from expenses if you want this money to last more than years youre gonna want to treat it as if it wasnt there wait what then why do i have this money if im not gonna use it you will use it just not as a sum of cash if you have $ million you are not going to go out and buy a $ million dollar house and a $ lamborghini youll only have $ left instead you might want to turn to fire or financial independence retire early there you are going to use your newfound money as a source of income an easy equation for this is thats it thats the equation of your net worth can be used yearly while your money still sits in investments and accrues roughly interest annually this way you beat inflation and you cover your expenses so to use our $ million under the rule thats $ you can spend annually and in theory you will never run out of funds while never working another day in your life or if you enjoy what youre doing you can add that to the equation as well how you break it up is up to you but you can very easily spend north of $ a year and still be in the green if you hold down a job meanwhile lets check in on our $ thats $ a year you can spend for the rest of your life if you wanted to retire today thats uncomfortably close to poverty you dont deserve that ampxb third protect it from yourself yes yourself as quickly as you made your money you can easily lose it in the best weeks of your life so right now emotions are probably high youre beyond excited you are itching to do something crazy with your money and probably want to buy something since you cant tell anyone per part dont buy anything right now yes you read that right dont buy anything if you need any proof on that look up what happens to lottery winners roughly of which go bankrupt rather set the money aside for a while you can determine this amount of time but a good rule of thumb is months in those months it gives you plenty of time to calm yourself collect your thoughts and figure out an actual plan on how to wisely use that money how you want to invest it how much you want to use per year and how much you owe in taxes yes the dreaded tword taxes youve gotta pay up and during that planning process youll have to come to terms with what this money is going to do for your life ampxb so there you have it a starter guide on how to survive your first days as a new millionaire written by someone who has never been a millionaire but i have seen some people make some awful mistakes about money and did my due diligence on what happens after someone gains a massive windfall and i have a feeling that more than a handful of you might be seeing a windfall come your way in the near future ampxb to close they say money cant buy you happiness but im often reminded of the scene from captain america money is only going to amplify how you want to live your life if you want to live generously leaving anonymous gifts and donations giving all you have away you can do that if you want to live egregiously expensive and live it up over spending at every turn you can also do that but you will need to face the consequences of either decision and if you in your nature default to one of these paths but dont want to it will take all the more effort to avoid it than if you didnt have this money at all ampxb oh who am i kidding this is wallstreetbets you will all be fine just be careful my friends as this is a fight that may last the rest of your life,2021-03-12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m3i8kc/how_to_keep_your_newly_minted_title_of_millionaire/,1615525200

m4cka9,GME,-40.13%,gme technicals dd short interest,DD,47,0.92,HomeDepotHank69,221,this will be long apes so please bull with me this is going to be a breakdown of gmes chart from a technical perspective as well as my thoughts on the short interest and where this is all going i would just like to apologize in advance for all of the lines on my charts i am fucking retarded and my smooth brain needs lots of lines but ill try to make it easy to understand technical breakdown on the day chart we can see that gme is going up in a stairstep pattern which is obviously extremely bullish a stairstep pattern is where it rises up consolidates lightly then uses the previous resistance as support for the next stairstep we are currently in a consolidation phase of that stairstep as you can see the red lines that i circled were previously resisstance but are now support this is bullish ampxb next and probably one of my favorite things is the fact that on the day we went from all the way down to we had strong support at the level which as i said above was the resistance from the first step which is now our support even better is the fact that our current consolidation is forming a pennant pattern from that support a pennant pattern usually indicates that a stock will continue its trend in this case up this is extremely bullish dare i say apeish the orange lines show the pennant pattern that im talking about and the two circles show the high and low of that pattern lmao also kinda looks like a torpedo cock and balls its important to note that although the chart makes it appear that it will be breaking that pattern soon the pennant could just extend so do not think that its going to break the pattern on monday because though it very well could it could also just continue consolidating ampxb when it finally stops consolidating and breaks this pattern to continue rising the green line above should act as support for our next stair step which would put us at ish for support which is huge for the day chart you can see that a few weeks ago we broke the giant triangle pattern which is how we got into the current bullish movement those lines are yellow ampxb finally in the chart above i have marked the areas of crucial resistance these are the fat green yellow and red lines i made them those colors because each one that we break is more crucial than the previous one because of the last squeeze what to take away from the chart action we are currently in a consolidation period of a stairstep pattern that has happened because we broke the triangle pattern that we started after the price went down from the last squeeze this is very bullish apeish again i apologize for all the lines im a technical trader and i make a shit ton of support and resistance lines for my smooth brain volume everyone is talking about the squeeze shorts and price action and blah blah but the thing that everyone needs to be talking about is volume volume volume volume the only way that any type of squeeze can happen is volume i know that people dont like the vw comparison and im not comparing them here just using this as an example but the squeeze was only able to happen because of tremendous volume ampxb as far as gmes current volume we are not there but dont get down on it becuase we will be the only way for shorts to be squeezed is for a major influx of volume to drive the price up significantly forcing them to cover in the previous squeeze volume spiked tremendously and would have continued to increase if brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying the ceo of interactive brokers even said that the price would reach over k if they didnt shut of buying why volume so for gmes volume its plain and simple it needs to increase but i will not that the fact that the price is increasing so much without massive volume is even more bullish apeish but hank how does volume increase excellent question tard brain for gme and most stocks but especially gme catalysts are what drives volume up below is a picture of gmes volume since the january action ampxb the first spike in volume was in late november when ryan cohen announced his stake but the jump wasnt super significant the first big spike that you can see is on january ish when they announced that ryan cohen was being added to the board in the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention the next jump in volume lots of red is when andrew left of shitron had his weeklong downsyndrome tantrum about gme and get his cheeks clapped by wsb this giant volume orgy is continued for the next few days when elon tweets gamestonk chamath buys a bunch of calls and other celebrities like mark cuban voice their support we then see volume teeter off because of the brokerage cucks ass ramming us the next spike in volume corresponds to when gme ousted their cfo many thought that ryan cohen led this we then see volume decrease a little volume the picks back up when gme announces that it has appointed cohen as the head of their committee on changing gme to a digital company volume has since gone down a little but the price has gone up erection what to take from this plain and simple volume is king volume is your wifes boyfriends wifes boyfriends bosss wifes boyfriend we cannot have another squeeze without volume but volume especially in gmes case is greatly correlated with catalysts volume catalysts here are some potential volume catalysts that could lead to the massive spike that we need gme appointing a new cfo gme appointing ryan cohen as ceo better than expected earnings an acquisition supportinvestment from big names ie cuban elon burry etc new committeesinitiativesanything relating to their digital transformation quadruple witching day march th still not sure how i feel about this and definitely dont think its the be all end all that many others do but it could certainly help overall it appears that the best catalysts are ones dealing with ryan cohen and digital transformation personally i think that if during their earnings call cohen announces hes gonna be ceo or announces some big digital move that will give us the volume we need its important to note that it appears that ryan cohen wants this to happen and why wouldnt he his net worth is tied to it as evident by the tweets that hes put out that though cryptic seem to be implying support of wsb and hatred of shorts roaring kitty has also been very cryptic lately and it appears that he thinks something big is coming too this is just speculation tho im tard ttm squeeze and macd two of my favorite indicators are macd and ttm squeeze i dont wanna explain them here because i only have so many chromosomes available to me each day but they essentially indicate momentum on my charts i combine the macd lines with the ttm squeeze because they move similarly and i think that ttm is superior to macds histogram as you can see on the year chart the macd is in a very bullish pattern right now what im more excited about is the ttm squeeze the colorful bars in a ttm squeeze indicator the light blue lines indicate that the price has extremely bullish momentum its in relation to bollinger bands and keltner channels when the bars turn dark blue there is still bullish momentum but its fading the red bars indicate bearish momentum and the yellow bars indicate fading bearish momentum as you can see are currently in some very strong light blue bars for a ttm squeeze there are usually light blue bars in an extremely bullish pattern from the last squeeze you can see that there are like really tiny light blue bars and then like bigger ones this indicates that we are currently in the middle ofapproaching giant price action but also that the current price action is better than last time and is forming a more stable high arching uptrend if youre thinking oh man unlce hank weve already had light blue bars the squeeze is almost over not so fast tard though i said that theres usually of these bars in an uptrend thats not always the case and going to dark blue bars simply may mean that we are consolidating and will go back to light blue bars overall all this should show you is that yes we are in a bullish trend and things are looking perfect this is one of my favorite indicators and i believe that its giving us insanely good signs ampxb a note about squeezes let me be clear if the brokerages wouldnt have cut off buying this would have gone up past $ ib ceo said this and hes a boomercuck because of this last time was not a short squeeze it was a gamma squeeze or a series of them a short squeeze would have resulted in a parabolic move to the upside accompanied by a parabolic jump in volume both the price and volume would look like very tall and skinny triangles see the volkswagen pattern for this a short squeeze does not happen over time it happens suddenly and very violently to the upside gamma squeezes on the other hand can happen over a period of time and can happen in small or big chunks its important to note that gamma squeezes can cause short squeezes and short squeezes can exacerbate game squeezes its a feedback loop which is why its so dangerous so currently i think that we are in the middle of a series of gamma squeezes that could lead to a short squeeze if there is a catalyst that creates volume shorts a lot of numbers have been floating around about short interest some say its and well above ive even seen imo its impossible to know right now finras release said it was about and thats the one that i believe to be the most likely definitely dont believe finras assplay however its important to note that those numbers very well could be correct the reason for this is because they cant take into consideration naked shorts if you dont know about this there are s of dds about it so imo there are scenarios here its literally just ish short interest on gme let me be clear this is still huge anything above is huge so is still amazing and has massive short squeeze potential for gme its actually above if the latter is true then the squeeze will happen and will also probably crash the financial system because as we know from when institutions get into these shady unregulated derivative bets on volatile things it usually creates a collateral effect personally i have no clue which one is correct the latter obviously sounds like a conspiracy but could very well be true because we all know how shady these funds are however it begs the question why are they still doing this the answer to this is they are either retarded and not in a good way doing it out of anger and spite and we all know how well emotional trading goes or they are in a bind and cant get out of it personally i think that the conspiracy about naked shorts and everything is either extremely false or extremely true if its extremely true then hfs are just kicking the can down the road hoping that we lose interest and the price decreases if its false then we still have short interest apes and daddy cohen tldr on this paragraph short numbers are conflicting and its impossible to know which is correct or if the naked short theory is true either way i like the stock closing thots the most important thing as i said is fucking volume this is not just gonna magically happen sure the price could very well keep increasing over the coming daysweeks on low volume and small gamma squeezes could happen but until we get a surge in volume through a catalyst we are not going to see the short squeeze remember the squeeze has not squoze until there is a parabolic move in price and volume over a very short period of time im talking trading getting halted times in a single day on the upside do i think that these next few weeks are going to be very important yes especially next week and earnings week but do i think its over if not fuck no so with that being said please try to avoid talking about dates as a certainty because it could lead to some of the younger tards selling because theyre disappointed make sure to do what rensole does and say that it could happen that its a possibility not that its the endgame or a certainty finally continued talk about gme continued buying and holding and continued retardation are key this is not

$cpng coupang aka amazon of korea aka chef pang aka c piddy because yall need to put some respect on its name its one of the largest tech companies to ipo on the nyse ever $b and the largest tech ipo in south korean history this isnt just some company its the company some of its notable backers are softbank blackrock bill ackman stanley druckenmiller and david frankel before trying to understand coupang you have to understand south korea as a country ape must read south korea is a firstworld country with the th largest economy ie gdp in the world that makes them bigger than russia spain australia mexico indonesia netherlands turkey saudi arabia switzerland poland taiwan sweden belgium thailand argentina nigeria iran you get the point they also have the th largest ecommerce market in the world it is also the ultimate turnaround story up until the mids they were a thirdworld japanese colony but in it is a first world country with one of the largest economies in the world and they did this in about years with their focus on tech and industrials as well as entertainment samsung hyundai kia lg kpop kpop is an international sensation right now $m export reported aug last year and growing also just know how advanced they are technologically they have had rfid chips a decade before us theyve had g for years they have the best esports gamers in the world they are no stranger to the worldwide web a big reason why they are so successful is because they are nd in the world in how much of their national gdp they spend on rampd getting back to coupang $cpng is only cash flow negative right now because they invested s of millions of dollars into their infrastructure allowing them to have of south koreas population million million within miles of their distribution centers they can only do this because of south koreas population lives in the seoul metropolitan area yes fucking percent million people thats like new york cities sidebyside south koreas annual online sales is $ billion and ecommerce sales of total retail sales $cpng sales went from $b in to $b in growth they also increased their market share from in to in growth so if the south korean ecommerce market grows at a it will be $b by risks amp rebuttals they sell mostly their own products ok theyve got strong customer loyalty can they expand their business to incorporate more rd party sellers in the future potential is there low gross profit margin retail has always historically been a low profit margin business is it possible for them to introduce a new high margin product or service absolutely still cash flow negative did you see the revenue growth $b to $b in one year theyre a growth company in its early stages i also mentioned above how theyre investing s of millions into their infrastructure distribution centers within miles of of population they dont have aws its not a literal copy of amazon they are also growing their ecommerce business before focusing on anything else sales went from $b to $b in one year they need to saturate this market before focusing on anything else its highly likely they will introduce new high profit product or service in the coming years their founder is a harvard drop out they dominate only in south korea whats wrong with that even with the south korean ecommerce market alone $cpng can become a $b company they are focused on dominating their immediate market im sure theyll create new services and create new sources of revenue once the korean market is saturated theyll figure out a way to expand these south koreans are smart and good at tech dont underestimate them valuation price target if in $cpng has a market share they will have $b in sales amazon has market share of us in with a conservative ps of that puts $cpng fair value at $ per share $b sales x $b valuation if they are doing well and they have hype with a ps of baba has cpang has then $cpng should be $ per share $b x $b valuation and this is if they dont create any new products or services think about that no new products or services just purely their ecommerce business and its still going to be worth $ per share if they launch an awslike thing or maybe another service thats just waiting to be discovered theyre going to do an additional $b easy with the market share they have so add another $ to the price targets as one of the technologically most advanced countries in the world $cpng is not here to stay its here to takeover south korea conclusion my thesis is heavily dependent on them expanding their business with new high margin productsservices but this is a bet i am willing to make harvard drop out softbank blackrock bill ackman one of the most technologically advanced countries in the world etc i guarantee they will innovate oh and even if its not them developing something internally they can always acquire a company theyre going to do billions in profits soon that is a lot of money its under $ today with an $b

m5wamk,None,N/A,whats actually going on with treasuries potential tlt play,DD,5,1,GreenDildoSurprise,11,so why have treasuries actually tank recently is the wave of hyperinflation finally coming probably not the recent drop in treasuries was likely just the result of some boring banking regulation exemptions expiring this month back in march bank deposits and us treasuries were exempt from what is known as the supplementary leverage ratio since this is really hard to explain accurately and briefly and most of you cant read anyway the nutshell version is that slr tells banks they must have a certain amount of capital relative to various assets on their books investments deposits etc in order to ensure a bank can withstand a market downturn why do you care well the slr exemption expires this month which means that both ust and customer deposits will now factor back into this equation at the same time the banks are about to take in a shitload of stimulus money as deposits also the fomc meets tomorrow and will likely be deciding on whether they will extend the slr last time around a lot of democrats were very against these slr exemptions and there is a good chance the slr rule wont be extended due to political factors regardless of economicfinancial factors likely banks having been dumping ust to come into compliance with regulations after this exemption expires additionally whether the fed will implement some type of yield curve control will likely be decided at this meeting well be hearing about that on which means theres likely to be heavy volatility in treasuries this week if the slr exemption is extended or the fed announces some type of ycc we might see treasuries eaten up at the end of the week if they announce neither we might see another dump i honestly have no idea which way it will go but the volatility on tlt is low enough that i dont see any reason you cant play both sides ps because the mods have decided to put filters in i can post but cant reply to your comments until i whore myself for more comment karma so ill try to pm you if you leave a decent question positions pc,2021-03-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wamk/whats_actually_going_on_with_treasuries_potential/,1615780800

m5wglc,GME,-40.13%,gme trading strategy to catalyze the squeeze,DD,21,0.96,AJDillonsMiddleLeg,290,i made a comment yesterday on a post that did some technical analysis on gme and several people asked that i turn that comment into a post so here it is obviously im going to start by saying all of this is based on my opinion of what needs to happen to spark the squeeze first the comment as it was ive seen lots of bullish ta on gme keep in mind all ta requires volume to play out how it should we havent had any volume on gme in over a week holding shares simply isnt enough needs constant all day every single day buying of shares and in the money options if you buy options that are in the money they literally cant price pin because they cant get and keep the price below current market so you force immediate share buying by market makers to hedge and virtually eliminate their means of counterattack which has been price pinning at the point of maximum pain price at which most contracts expire worthless if you are intending to help push the squeeze buy shares throughout the day every day if you are playing options mostly buy calls in the money if youre buying otm calls buy as close to current price as you can afford the more imbalanced otm calls are the more theyre just going to price pin at maximum pain they literally cannot do this if there is a ridiculous amount of new itm call interest that they have to buy shares to hedge essentially we cannot rely on normal technical indicators for movement with gamestop there are two major reasons manipulation we cannot do anything about this really aside from buy and hold technicals actually have a tendencies to work in reverse when a stock is being manipulated at these levels the shorts while stuck in a stupid position arent stupid they know when the ta is indicating a bullish setup and that is the best time for them to attack the stock to break the setup volume all technical setups require volume to play out if volume doesnt follow the technical setup fails and the price action is unpredictable except in this case it goes down because its being shorted at every chance so what do we need to do hold yes but that cant be it if we are doing nothing but holding this will be a stalemate that they will probably win as sections of retail gets bored or impatient they can literally hold us in a stalemate for monthsyears if volume never shows up to move the price yes they pay more interest the longer they have to wait theyll just manipulate other sectors of the market to force gains and cover their losses unless the sec steps in to stop market manipulation volume without volume there is no endgame look at every day weve had spikes look at the volume now look at the past week or two we arent making progress because nobody is buying shares aside from some whale algos that are simply fighting off the short attacks believe it or not the whales do need retail support to force the squeeze the whales are the ones creating momentum from time to time if it catches on they can follow it up but if they just go all out to create a surge and nobody follows behind them to buy they are literally risking billions of dollars to fail this thing will likely happen in waves over the course of a few days if you look at any day there are surges in buy volume but theyre short thats likely a whale testing the market if they see confirmationfollowup from the market its less risky for them to send a second wave of buying pressure so it will be something like whale buy retail confirmation buys whale buy runaway effect gamma squeeze and then finally short squeeze all of those things have to happen consecutively fluidly and fairly quickly to beat any kind of counter attack now this is going to sound counterintuitive but in order to catalyze the squeeze we have to stop just buying the dip when volume picks up and the price is spiking thats the most important time to buy thats the point when additional buying pressure is most important and until the retail market confirms pressure on one of those spikes we are going to keep bouncing back and forth options the other side of the coin is options purchases stop devoting the majority of your capital to far otm lotto tickets this helps the short positions because it forces the market makers to help the shorts market makers that sell call options have to hedge their risk when you buy an $c it does two things they dont have to buy very many shares up front to remain risk neutral in incentivizes the market makers to pin the price you can do some additional reading on max pain price in options but it is essentially the closing price at which the largest number of options expire worthless when you buy otm call options youre increasing the maximum pain price which makes it easier for market makers and shorts to pin the price there if however youre buying a ton of itm call options youre doing two things deep itm calls have a delta of essentially this means that in order to remain risk neutral the market makers essentially has to buy shares immediately upon selling you the contract it lowers the max pain price by creating an imbalance towards lower strikes having the most oi this means in order to pin the price at max pain they would need to drop it from its current price not only do you force market makers to be risk neutral immediately meaning they dont care where the price goes you also force them to immediately put buying pressure on the stock price if you must buy otm calls buy ones that are at least closer to being itm the further otm you buy calls the more likely the price will go sideways you can also sell calls and roll them into higher prices to remain leveraged as the price increases once it achieves a runaway squeeze which will be easy to identify you can start buying your lotto tickets tldr in my opinion if you want to help catalyze the squeeze you need to buy shares when the price is spiking and buy calls that are at least in the money 💎🙌🚀🌖,2021-03-15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5wglc/gme_trading_strategy_to_catalyze_the_squeeze/,1615780800

mfc86c,AMRS,-14.75%,$amrs 🚀 🌕 the ultimate dd 🚀 🌕 deep longterm value with massive nearterm catalysts,DD,20,0.95,SubjectDiscipline,630,note nothing in this post is financial advice tldr amyris $amrs is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers manufactures and sells sustainably created ingredients and products $amrss proprietary technology has a nearendless number of applications and a staggering total addressable market potentially in the trillions of dollars after a decade of heavily investing in rampd to advance their platform both the companys technology and business model recently turned the corner laying the foundation for incredible value creation over near and longterm horizons within the next three trading days $amrs will announce the completion of two strategic transactions worth more than $ million sending the stock to the fucking moon this is a deep value play but for all you short squeeze junkies $amrs does happen to have relatively significant short interest at of the float i expect that the jump in price from $amrss upcoming transaction announcements to dump gasoline onto a raging fire sending the shorts to an early grave while raining tendies from the sky for the longs the play – buying shares of the $amrs stock or april calls with strikes above $ my positions i believe in this company over both long and short time horizons see below for current positions positions background i was a relatively early investor in $enph and after the success of that investment sub $ share price in now trading above $ a share i was looking to invest in a company with a similarly checkered past with a catalyst to turn the corner quickly as with $enph the company needed to have invaluable technology with the potential for huge nearterm gains to compensate for the risk i couldnt have been more elated discovering $amrs which checked all the boxes $amrs has performed well this year so far but we are lightyears away from the companys potential both over the short and long term $amrs business this business is complicated but ill do my best to summarize some key points founded by a group of berkley scientists $amrs is a synthetic biotechnology company that engineers manufactures and sells sustainably created ingredients and products into several markets including health amp wellness clean beauty and flavor amp fragrance within health amp wellness $amrs focuses on alternative sweeteners vitamins and food ingredients in flavor amp fragrance $amrs produces natural oils and aroma chemicals for a range of applications in clean beauty $amrs focuses on clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients for all you tree huggers their production and products are totally sustainable and by creating otherwise naturally occurring molecules in the lab $amrs saves the destruction of animals and other natural resources as an example they produce a skincare molecule called squalene that otherwise requires killing sharks to get it $amrs generates revenue from a combination of a partnership model and a whollyowned direct model in the partnership model $amrs creates a moleculeingredient in the lab and scales it on a commercial level on behalf of a partner who then uses the moleculeingredient in one of its products which the partner markets and sells to its own customers $amrs captures revenues from producing and selling the moleculeingredient to the partner $amrs receives royalties from the partners product sales that contain the ingredient created by $amrs $amrs has many commercial industrial level partners including firmenich givaudan dsm yifan the us department of energy and darpa on the retail side $amrs has recently announced partnerships to create new brands such as jvn johnathan van ness clean haircare brand launching summer rose inc rosie huntingtonwhiteley highend cosmetics brand launching q and most recently they announced a partnership with minerva focusing on zero carbon protein production in the whollyowned direct model $amrs sells its developed ingredients through brands that $amrs currently owns including biossance highend skincare pipette skincare for babies purecane synthetic sugar similar to splenda as well as brands it has recently acquired such as teresana sustainably sourced cannabinoids launching q and costa brazil clean luxury skincare acquired in q separately the company has also recently made headway using its technology in the production of rna for use in mrna vaccines though this is in its early stages $amrss consumer brands are distributed through many highprofile channels including amazon target walmart and sephora in addition to their own directtoconsumer websites it is no surprise that they have demonstrated ridiculous revenue growth of in alone q earnings investor presentation q earnings investor presentation notable recent investors no doubt $amrss progress has captured the attention of some incredibly famous investors the most notable being the billionaire venture capitalist john doerr whose current portfolio of investments includes alphabetgoogle where his investment is worth over $ billion alone doordash bloom energy quantamscape and of course amyris $amrs where his investment is worth about $ doerr currently serves on the board of directors at google and $amrs and previously served on the board of amazon john doerr ownership other investments short interest as shown in the below ownership statistics over of $amrss tradable float is sold short which amounts to approximately million shares as of with a day average daily trading volume of just million shares and just million shares traded last friday i suspect that when the company delivers on its upcoming transactions this week trading volumes will increase from intense buying a rising share price will put tremendous pressure on short sellers to cover their positions leading to a classic short squeeze and an increased pop in the stock source factset upcoming transaction announcements nearterm catalysts beginning last november $amrs began discussing a series of three upcoming strategic transactions that have truly changed the game for the company each transaction is different but effectively involve the monetization of a moleculeingredient whereby a partner pays $amrs a significant upfront cash payment as well as licensing fees royalties over a multiyear period the significance of these transactions cannot be understated as they provide cash to the business while creating recurring revenue streams in effect these deals allow $amrs to selffund its business without diluting existing investors from new equity offerings or extremely expensive debt this is what the market has been craving the first of the three closed last december with a transaction value of just $ million and the stock has flying ever since gaining over so far this year the remaining two transactions are set to close within the next three days with an expected total value of over $ million for just one of the two transactions here is the ceo on the q earnings call dated march q earnings transcript dated march the ceo reaffirmed that the transactions will close prior to the end of the first quarter several times thereafter including an industry conferences on cowen and roth as well as quietly in the last sentence of an unrelated press release on to those that would argue it is already priced in you are wrong for several reasons first this company has almost no intuitional coverage and is paid very little attention relative to more established biotechnology companies said differently the institutions that really set valuation and move the stock dont care enough yet to pay attention but they will $amrss investor base only continues to expand as more people wake up to its incredible potential second prior to the recent turnaround the company overpromised a few times just as companies that later mooned like $enph did it happens particularly with early stage companies so even in the efficient market fantasy world the companys public disclosures would have a credibility discount leaving substantial upside for investors today when the company inevitably delivers conclusion these strategic transactions will announce by no later than thursday morning and $amrs will be off to the fucking races for some context the suits at hc wainwright and roth capital partners currently have price targets of $ and $ i like the stock and i think it is worth even more the play $amrs shares april calls with strikes $ and above good luck and

mkal7x,None,N/A,the uranium bull thesis is playing out to perfection a $bn market is emerging a multiyear run for the equities is inevitable,DD,29,0.84,BooOnClay,231,with so many exciting developments of late i wanted to share my on the current state of the uranium market focusing a bit on swu which i am very fond of haha as always i look forward to any feedback as am sure all are aware we have seen a jump in spot over last weeks while the increase was in large part to nonproducing mines physical purchasing i noticed a number of discussions on reddit and various discord servers stocktwits also seeming to suggest that this uptick in spot u was indicative of where we are in the current fuel cycle experienced investors in this sector will tell you however that this couldnt be further from the truth rather a more powerful indicator as to where we are in the cycle is by looking at the swu enrichment price based in large part on swu projections many expert investors are forecasting a $bn market for perspective during the last cycle the market peaked at $bn so what is swu for those very new to uranium investing a very quick overview might be helpful also for those more familiar than i am i appreciate the feedback swu short for separative work unit is a measure for the cost of enrichment generally speaking when swu prices are low utilities benefit by purchasing excess enrichment inventory at cheap prices using intermediaries ie carry trades conversely a rise in swu signifies that the demand for enrichment is growing as excess inventories are utilized by end users the utilities no longer aided by the secondary market instead turn to the uranium producers to purchase future contracts at much higher prices it follows logically that higher enrichment prices force the utilities to retreat back into the fuel cycle from conversion uf and even fabricated fuel purchasing to the beginning ie spot u which in turn drives those spot prices up additionally and perhaps most importantly higher swu prices on future contracts are essential in incentivizing the mines to come back online mcarthur and cigar lake for example need at least the $s and for paladin likely in the $s in order to justify their operational costs therefore swu is arguably the best indicator of where we are in the fuel cycle even when there are false startsspikes in the market which weve seen in the past couple years swu price is consistent what is the current swu price swu bottomed out at $ in august after so much excess accumulated in the years following fukushima since hitting that low swu has been on a relative straight line upwards currently estimated at $ this steady growth over the past years is one of if not the most compelling reason investors are so confident of a long bull market to come in this sector so how the is swu forecasting a $bn market of course there are a number of things we can look at that are driving this thing its becoming almost a daily occurrence now to see catalysts emerging ie breaking news this week on eu green energy qualifications the white house endorsing nuclear in as part of the clean energy standard however moreso than anything swu is at the core of the bull thesis which is that decarbonization of the electrical grid around the world is not possible without nuclear power duke energy corp just said the same yesterday as swu prices continue to rise it is inevitable that equity prices will follow denison is a fun example even now im still amazed at how many people claiming to have thousands of shares of certain uranium producers are surprised when they hear that denison isnt actually producing any uranium when utilities start executing term contracts with other producers at swu in the $s $s $s and beyond those mines will turn the lights back on the fact that they just bought spot above market is a pretty powerful indication of where things are headed as far as volume on these long term contracts it wont be long before denisons prices start to rise the same idea goes with cominak ranger etc moreover what happens when weve exhausted cigar lake and kazatomprom or mcarthur river it isnt just that we have a rising demand we need new projects coming into existence now in order to avoid a huge deficit in supply between the investment opportunities on these projects are extremely exciting and why $bn frankly i think $bn is conservative though something in this vicinity i have seen as the consensus among many experts market cap for publicly traded uranium is at bn right now and this is only the very beginning ultimately there are new players in the game with a ton of liquidity ie hedge funds and they are looking for value taking $urnm as one example the aum just months ago when it ipod was a few million now aum is $mm we also cannot ignore what is happening in china it is a huge growth story there there is also a spec frenzy but again looking at the big picture moreso than anything else i keep going back to swu for me it is the most powerful predictor of the multiyear bull run to come and while there will always be doubtful retail who to their credit have rightfully called false starts over the last couple years you cannot deny what years of rising swu enrichment prices means for where we are in the current cycle again i would be very interested to hear where folks agreedisagree any and all feedback is

mk4pod,PAVE,0.48%,an investment that will benefit from the infrastructure bill check out $pave etf,Discussion,30,0.86,ralphsdiorama,40,if you are looking for an infrastructure investment look not further than $pave etf its holdings are well diversified across the physical digital and energy infrastructure found in the bill and options are still very cheap at the moment here is everything you need to know about the etf from seeking alpha the global x us infrastructure development etf pave is in an excellent position to directly benefit from president bidens american jobs plan that was announced on wednesday in pittsburgh pa the proposed plan targets over $ trillion for direct investments into physical infrastructure including transportation schools hospitals and buildings as well as for energy water and digital infrastructure the pave etf holds many of the companies that will provide the materials tools services and components required for this infrastructure buildout and should handsomely benefit from it investment rationale president biden presented the american jobs plan part of his build back better initiative on wednesday in pittsburgh and the white house published a fact sheet on its website in a nutshell a broad summary of the infrastructure initiatives in the american jobs plan is shown below physical infrastructure transportation infrastructure b buildings schools and hospitals b infrastructure resilience b energy water and digital infrastructure cleantech clean energy and related infra b water utilities b digital infrastructure b in total the aggregate spending targeted directly at these infrastructure projects is over $ trillion the investment thesis here is simple find an infrastructure fund that can benefit directly from those investment dollars lets take a look at the pave etf and see what its prospects are going forward top holdings the pave infrastructure development etfs top holdings can be found on global x etf website and equate to roughly of what i would characterize as a moderately concentrated portfolio that holds a total of companies pave has $ billion in assets so even a weight of holding deere de results in a $ million stake many investors would consider deere and odd choice for an infrastructure etf considering it is generally regarded as focused solely on agriculture however de operates in three segments one of which is its construction amp forestry segment this segment manufactures machines for earth moving road building graders excavators material handling crushers and screeners and asphalt pavers de is up over the past year yet has an estimated forward pe of only x the holding with a weight is motion control systems specialist parkerhannifin corp ph which operates a diversified industrial segment that provides sealing shielding vibration and thermal solutions as well as filters noise abatement and contaminate removal systems for water air fuel oil and other liquids ph is also up over the past year has a forward pex and yields the eaton corp etn is the holding and has weight within the portfolio eaton pays a $ annual dividend yields and has a forward pex the company is heavily involved in the power management sector and likely will provide many of the electrical components and assemblies needed to build out the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure detailed in the american jobs plans investments into clean tech and clean energy the and holdings are railroad companies norfolk southern nsc kansas city southern ksu and csx corp csx along with holding union pacific unp these four holdings alone equate to of the entire portfolio obviously this etf is betting that these rail freight providers will be hauling much of the gravel rock asphalt lumber steel and products and assemblies that will be needed to build out the infrastructure of roads bridges buildings and energy and water systems as detailed in the ajp these railroads will also benefit from opening up and a generally stronger economy some of that has been fueled by the excellent progress the biden administration and bigpharma when it comes to the vaccine rollout and as a result from general expectations that the us economy is opening up fast and will see very strong growth in the h of the year meantime canadian pacific cp recently offered to buy ksu for $ billion which has added some merger mania to the sector surprisingly the fund does not hold caterpillar cat cat is generally thought to be one of the main beneficiaries of an infrastructure bill but considering that stock has doubled over the past year perhaps the management team feels it is overvalued but with a forward pex and a yield cat seems to be an odd omission in my opinion looking through the rest of the portfolio see the full list of holdings here we find many of the companies that sell the raw materials steel aluminum copper lumber asphalt filters etc needed to for as the basic building blocks for transportation electrical utility and water infrastructure performance pave etf wins by a considerable margin over ifra on a nav basis and neither etf pays that much in the way of income and respectively pave is x the size of ifra which has $ million in aum over a shorter timeframe that encompasses the yearofcovid and the period when discussions about an infrastructure bill to get americans back to work with goodpaying jobs got serious pave has also outperformed the ifra etf by a significant margin fund basics these metrics all come from the global x pave etf webpage expense ratio aum $ billion pe ratio x forward pe ratio x pricetobook x day secyield roughly of the fund is invested in the industrials and materials sectors risks considering the strong rally the pave etf has had over the past year in anticipation of the infrastructure bill much has already been built into the price that said note the fund is not overweight any highflying cleanenergy names and despite the growth of some of these stocks many still sell at very reasonable valuation levels see the forward pes of some of the top holding discussed earlier the biggest risk is getting a substantial the american jobs plan through congress it should get through the democratically controlled house in roughly the same shape as presented as we learned with the american rescue plan despite the objections of some of the more progressive members of the democratic party they have shown some level of pragmatism in that they know if the legislation doesnt get through the very narrowly controlled senate it wont matter what they pass in the house much is likely to depend on what senator joe manchin dwest virginia decides he will support as if history is any indication the ajp will get zero republicans votes so the democrats must get all votes so that vice president harris can break the tie i believe the democrats will push the legislation through because a recent poll by navigator recently found broad bipartisan support over for an infrastructure bill by american voters tldr summary amp conclusion for those investors that dont typically invest in the infrastructure sector myself included but want to have some exposure to where their tax dollars are going in the american jobs plan the pave etf seems like an excellent choice the portfolio is full of solidly profitable companies that are reasonably valued and in an excellent position to benefit from the buildout of us infrastructure pave is a buy,2021-04-04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mk4pod/an_investment_that_will_benefit_from_the/,1617508800
mk5h3m,None,N/A,the us govt has a huge incentive to massively underreport inflation,Discussion,171,0.93,Natural_Profession_8,830,tldr the us federal government has a massive incentive to underreport inflation a underreporting of inflation saves the us govt between $ billion and $ trillion per year its likely that such a huge moral hazard has led the government to systematically underreport inflation over the past few decades for background the bureau of labor statistics bls calculates inflation it releases a measure known as the consumer price index or cpi the formula used to calculate cpi is rather complex and opaque and has been changed numerous times over the years the effect of these changes has been to lower the average reported inflation number many government revenues and expenditures are inflationlinked either directly or indirectly directly linked social security payments social security payments are linked to a measure known as cpiw very similar to the cpi every year the amount a social security recipient receives goes up in proportion to the amount of inflation it has been estimated that the social security program has total unfunded liabilities worth $ trillion every of underreported inflation decreases the real value of these unfunded liabilities by $ billion tax brackets tax brackets are adjusted upwards to account for inflation this means when the government underreports inflation more people move up into higher tax brackets its hard to calculate the exact effect of this on government revenues treasury inflationprotected securities these are treasuries that increase the amount they pay back in both interest and principle according to inflation they are linked to the cpi these securities known as tips compromise of the us federal debt this is $ trillion every of underreported inflation decrease the real value of the principle of this debt by $ billion there are also increases to the interest payments on this debt indirectly linked debt interest payments investors will demand higher returns from treasuries in periods where they expect higher inflation the us government has $ trillion in treasury debt the yearly cost of servicing this debt is of that roughly $ billion in if investors were to expect higher inflation this yearly cost would go up by $ billion for every increase in expected inflation there are likely many other government programs that benefit from underreporting inflation these are just the main ones i could find when we add up all these policies we see that underreporting inflation by just can save the government between $ billion and $ trillion a year this is of the entire tax revenue of the us government underreporting inflation by a year would save the government more money than it brings in from taxes every year evidence of underreporting there has probably never been a time in history when such a massive moral hazard existed and was not exploited is there any evidence that the us government has in fact been understating inflation changes to the cpi formula originally the cpi was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods in this case the cpi was a cost of goods index cogi however over time the us congress embraced the view that the cpi should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living﻿ consequently the cpi has evolved into a cost of living index coli over the years the methodology used to calculate the cpi has undergone numerous revisions according to the bls the changes removed biases that caused the cpi to overstate the inflation rate the new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution substitution the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket﻿ the overall result tends to be a lower cpi however critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a cogi to a coli as a purposeful manipulation that allows the us government to report a lower cpi essentially the methodology used to calculate the cpi was changed to purposefully reduce the amount of inflation that is reported when a good is considered to be of increased quality its price increase is lowered to reflect this when the price of one good goes up its relative weighting in the cpi is reduced and another lowerpriced good is substituted for it rent in the average us rent was $ in it was $ this is an increase of or an average yearly increase of during the same time the cpi has gone from to which is only a increase or an average yearly increase of if we use rent as the true measure of inflation cpi has underreported inflation by per year keep in mind that during the period just mentioned the us experienced the most epic collapse in housing prices it had ever seen during the crisis the housing bubble was already far along by nonetheless rent increases managed to outstrip the cpi what do you think is the us government massively underreporting
